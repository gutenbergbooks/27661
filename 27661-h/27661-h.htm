<div class="sidenote">From the Top of the Hill</div>

<p>The girl paused among the birches and
drew a long breath of relief. It was
good to be outdoors after the countless annoyances
of the day; to feel the earth springing
beneath her step, the keen, crisp air bringing
the colour to her cheeks, and the silence of the
woods ministering to her soul.</p>

<p>From the top of the hill she surveyed her little
world. Where the small white houses clustered
in the valley, far below her, she had
spent her five-and-twenty years, shut in by the
hills, and, more surely, by the iron bars of
circumstance. To her the heights had always
meant escape, for in the upper air and in
solitude she found detachment&mdash;a sort of
heavenly perspective upon the affairs of the
common day.</p>

<p>Down in the bare, brown valley the river lay
asleep. Grey patches of melting snow still
filled the crevices along its banks, and fragments
of broken crystal moved slowly toward
the ultimate sea. The late afternoon sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
touched the sharp edges, here and there to a
faint iridescence. "The river-god dreams of
rainbows," thought Rosemary, with a smile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Valley</div>

<p>Only one house was near the river; the
others were set farther back. The one upon
the shore was the oldest and largest house in
the valley, severely simple in line and with a
certain air of stateliness. The broad, Colonial
porch looked out upon the river and the hills
beyond it, while all around, upon the southern
slope between the opposite hills and the valley,
were the great vineyards of the Marshs', that
had descended from father to son during the
century that had elapsed since the house
was built.</p>

<p>The gnarled and twisted vines scarcely
showed now, upon the grey-brown background
of the soil, but in a few places, where
the snow had not yet melted, the tangled
black threads were visible. Like the frame
surrounding a tapestry, great pines bordered
the vineyard save on the side nearest the valley,
for the first of the Marshs, who had planted
the vineyard and built the house, had taken
care to protect his vines from the north-east
storms.</p>

<p>The clanging notes of a bell, mellowed by
distance, came faintly from the valley below.
Rosemary took out the thin, old watch that had
been her mother's and her mother's mother's
before her, and set the hands at four upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
pale gold dial. Then she drew up the worn gold
chain that hung around her neck, under her
gown, and, with the key that dangled from it,
wound the watch. In an hour or so, probably,
it would stop, but it was pleasant to hear the
cheerful little tick while she waited.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Red Ribbon</div>

<p>The doors of the white schoolhouse in the
valley burst open and the tide of exuberant
youth rushed forth. Like so many ants, the
children swarmed and scattered, their shrill
voices sounding afar. Rosemary went to a
hollow tree, took out a small wooden box,
opened it, and unwound carefully a wide
ribbon of flaming scarlet, a yard or more in
length. Digging her heels into the soft earth,
she went down to the lowest of the group of
birches, on the side of the hill that overlooked
the valley, and tied the ribbon to a drooping
bough. Then she went back to the top of the
hill, where a huge log, rolled against two trees,
made a comfortable seat for two people.</p>

<p>Five minutes of the allotted twenty had
passed since Rosemary had set her watch. At
twenty minutes past four, or, at the most,
twenty-five, he would come. For three years
and more he had never failed to answer the
signal, nor, indeed, to look for it when he
brushed the chalk from his clothes and locked
the door of the schoolhouse behind him.</p>

<p>A kindly wind, in passing, took the ribbon
and made merry with it. In and out among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the bare boughs of the birches it fluttered
like a living thing, and Rosemary laughed
aloud, as she had not done for many days.
The hill, the scarlet signal, and the man who
was coming symbolised, to her, the mysterious
world of Romance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">World of Romance</div>

<p>Sometimes the birches were shy dryads,
fleeing before the wrath of some unknown god.
At other times, they were the Muses, for,
as it happened, there were nine in the group
and no others upon the hill. The vineyard
across the valley was a tapestry, where, from
earliest Spring until the grapes were gathered
colour and light were caught and imprisoned
within the web. At the bend in the river,
where the rushes grew thickly, the river-god
kept his harp, which answered with shy,
musical murmurings to every vagrant wind.</p>

<p>Again, the hill was a tower, and she a captive
princess, who had refused to marry except
for love, and Love tarried strangely upon the
way. Or, sometimes, she was the Elaine of an
unknown Launcelot, safely guarding his shield.
She placed in the woods all the dear people of
the books, held forever between the covers and
bound to the printed page, wondering if they,
too, did not long for freedom.</p>

<p>The path up the hill wound in and out among
the trees, and so it happened that Rosemary
heard muffled footsteps before she saw him
coming. A wayfaring squirrel, the first of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
family to venture out, scampered madly up
a tree and looked down upon the girl with
questioning, fearful eyes. She rose from the
log and looked up, with her hands outstretched
in unconscious pleading.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He Comes</div>

<p>"Oh," she murmured, "don't be afraid of
me!"</p>

<p>"I'm not," answered a man's voice. "I
assure you I'm not."</p>

<p>"I wasn't speaking to you," she laughed,
as she went to meet him.</p>

<p>"No?" he queried, flushed and breathless
from the climb. "I wonder if there is anyone
else for whom you wave red ribbons from your
fortress!"</p>

<p>"Take it down, will you please?"</p>

<p>"Wait until I get three full breaths&mdash;then I
will."</p>

<p>She went back to the log while he awkwardly
untied the ribbon, rolled it up, in clumsy
masculine fashion, and restored it to the
wooden box in the hollow tree. "Aren't
you cold?" he asked, as he sat down beside
her.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I'm too vividly alive to be cold, ever."</p>

<p>"But what's the use of being alive unless
you can live?" he inquired, discontentedly.</p>

<p>She sighed and turned her face away. The
colour vanished from her cheeks, the youth
from her figure. Pensively, she gazed across
the valley to the vineyard, where the black,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
knotted vines were blurred against the soil in
the fast-gathering twilight. His eyes followed
hers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rosemary</div>

<p>"I hate them," he said, passionately. "I
wish I'd never seen a grape!"</p>

<p>"Were the children bad to-day?" she asked,
irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"Of course. Aren't they always bad?
What's the use of caging up fifty little imps
and making 'em learn the multiplication
table when they don't even aspire to the alphabet?
Why should I have to teach 'em to read
and write when they're determined not to
learn? Why do I have to grow grapes when it
would be the greatest joy of my life to know
that I'd never have to see, touch, taste, or even
smell another grape in this world or the next?"</p>

<p>She turned toward him. A late Winter
sunset shimmered in the west like some pale,
transparent cloth of gold hung from the walls
of heaven, but the kindly light lent no beauty
to her face. Rosemary's eyes were grey and
lustreless, her hair ashen, and almost without
colour. Her features were irregular and her
skin dull and lifeless. She had not even the
indefinable freshness that is the divine right of
youth. Her mouth drooped wistfully at the
corners, and even the half-discouraged dimple
in her chin looked like a dent or a scar.</p>

<p>The bare hands that lay listlessly in her lap
were rough and red from much uncongenial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
toil. He looked at her for a moment, still
absorbed in himself, then, as he noted the
pathos in every line of her face and figure, the
expression of his face subtly changed. His
hand closed quickly over hers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their Moods</div>

<p>"Forgive me, Rosemary&mdash;I'm a brute. I
have no right to inflict my moods upon you."</p>

<p>"Why not? Don't I bring mine to you?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes&mdash;not often."</p>

<p>"Let's get them out where we can look
them over," she suggested, practically. "What
do you hate most?"</p>

<p>"Grapes," he replied, readily, "and then
children who aren't interested in the alphabet.
All day I've been saying: 'See the cat. Can
the cat run? Yes, the cat can run.' Of course
they could repeat it after me, but they couldn't
connect it in any way with the printed page.
I sympathised strongly with an unwashed
child of philosophical German lineage who
inquired, earnestly: 'Teacher, what's the good
of dat?'"</p>

<p>"What else do you hate?"</p>

<p>"Being tied up. Set down in one little
corner of the world and being obliged to stay
in it. I know to a certainty just what's going
to happen to-morrow and next day and the
day after that. Point out any day on the
calendar, months ahead, and I can tell you
just what I'll be doing. Nothing is uncertain
but the weather."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">His Looks</div>

<p>"Some people pray for anchorage," she said.</p>

<p>"I never have," he flashed back. "I want
the open sea&mdash;tide and tempest and grey
surges, with the wind in my face and the thrill
of danger in my heart! I want my blood to
race through my body; I want to be hungry,
cold, despairing, afraid&mdash;everything! God,
how I want to live!"</p>

<p>He paced back and forth restlessly, his
hands in his pockets. Rosemary watched
him, half afraid, though his mood was far
from strange to her. He was taller than the
average man, clean-shaven, and superbly built,
with every muscle ready and even eager for
use. His thirty years sat lightly upon him,
though his dark hair was already slightly grey
at the temples, for his great brown eyes were
boyish and always would be. In the half-light,
his clean-cut profile was outlined against
the sky, and his mouth trembled perceptibly.
He had neither the thin, colourless lips that
would have made men distrust him, nor the
thick lips that would have warned women to
go slowly with him and to watch every step.</p>

<p>With obvious effort, he shook himself partially
free of his mood. "What do you hate?"
he asked, gently.</p>

<p>"Brown alpaca, sassafras tea, the eternal
dishes, the scrubbing, the endless looking for
dust where dust would never dare to stay,
and&mdash;" She paused, and bit her lips.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Always Fighting</div>

<p>"Might as well go on," he urged, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"I can't. It isn't nice of me."</p>

<p>"But it's true. I don't know why you
shouldn't hate your Grandmother and your
Aunt Matilda. I do. It's better to be truthful
than nice."</p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<p>"Sincerity always has a charm of its own.
Even when two men are fighting, you are
compelled to admire their earnestness and
singleness of purpose."</p>

<p>"I wish you lived where you could admire
Grandmother and Aunt Matilda. They're
always fighting."</p>

<p>"No doubt. Isn't it a little early for
sassafras tea?"</p>

<p>"I thought so, but Grandmother said Spring
was coming early this year. She feels it in her
bones and she intends to be ready for it."</p>

<p>"She should know the signs of the seasons,
if anyone does. How old is she now?"</p>

<p>"Something past eighty."</p>

<p>"Suffering Moses! Eighty Springs and Summers
and Autumns! Let me see&mdash;I was
only twenty when I began with the grapes.
If I live to be eighty, that means I've got to go
to town sixty times to buy baskets, sell the
crop, and hire help&mdash;go through the whole
process from Spring to frost sixty times, and
I've only done it ten times. Fifty more!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
And when the imps who unwillingly learned
their multiplication table from me are grandparents
on their own account, I'll still be
saying: 'See the cat! Can the cat run? Yes,
the cat can run.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Slaves of the Vineyard</div>

<p>"Why don't you sell the vineyard?" she
asked, though her heart sank at the mere
suggestion.</p>

<p>"Sell it? Why didn't the Ancient Mariner
sell his albatross and take a nice little trip
around the world on the proceeds? Mother
would die of a broken heart if I mentioned it to
her. The Marsh family have been the slaves
of that vineyard since the first mistaken ancestor
went into the grape business. We've
fertilised it, pruned it, protected it, tied it up,
sat up nights with it, fanned the insects away
from it, hired people to pick the fruit and pack
it, fed the people, entertained them, sent
presents to their wives and children&mdash;we've
done everything! And what have we had for
it? Only a very moderate living, all the
grapes we could eat, and a few bottles of musty
old wine.</p>

<p>"Mother, of course, has very little to do
with it, and, to her, it has come to represent
some sort of entailed possession that becomes
more sacred every year. It's a family heirloom,
like a title, or some very old and valuable
piece of jewelry. Other people have family
plate and family traditions, but we've got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
a vineyard, or, to speak more truthfully, it
has us."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Happy Muses</div>

<p>"Look at the Muses," said Rosemary, after
a silence. "Do you think they've gone to
sleep?"</p>

<p>The nine slender birches, that had apparently
paused in their flight down the hillside, were,
indeed, very still. Not a twig stirred, and
the white trunks were ghostly in the twilight.
Seemingly they leaned toward each other for
protection and support; for comfort in the
loneliness of the night.</p>

<p>"Happy Muses," he responded. "No vineyard
to look after and no school to teach."</p>

<p>"And no Grandmother," continued Rosemary,
"and no Aunt. Nor any dishes or
brooms or scrubbing-brushes, or stoves that
are possessed by evil spirits."</p>

<p>Star-like, a single light appeared in the
front window of the big white house on the
shore of the river. It was answered almost
immediately by another, far across the stream.</p>

<p>"I like to watch the lights," the girl went
on. "The first one is always in your house."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Mother dislikes twilight."</p>

<p>"Ours is the last&mdash;on account of the price
of oil."</p>

<p>"Here," he said. "I almost forgot your
book. And I brought you two candles this
time. You mustn't read by the light of one&mdash;you'll
spoil your eyes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Saying Good-Night</div>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Marsh! Thank you so much!"</p>

<p>"You're very welcome, Miss Starr."</p>

<p>"Please don't. I like to have you call me
Rosemary."</p>

<p>"Then you must call me Alden. I've
been telling you that for almost two years."</p>

<p>"I know, but I can't make myself say it,
somehow. You're so much older and wiser
than I."</p>

<p>"Don't be vain of your youth. I'm only
five years ahead of you, and, as for wisdom,
anybody could teach a country school in
Winter and grow grapes the rest of the time."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that. Come, it's
getting late."</p>

<p>They went down the hill together, hand in
hand like two children. The young man's
mood had changed for the better and he was
whistling cheerfully. They stopped at the
corner where she must turn to go home.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she said.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Rosemary. I wish I could
come to see you sometimes."</p>

<p>"So do I, but it's better that you shouldn't."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you can't come over in the
evenings occasionally. I always read to Mother
and you might as well listen, too. I'd gladly
take you home."</p>

<p>"It would be lovely," she sighed, "but
I can't."</p>

<p>"You know best," he answered, shivering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
"It's pretty cold up there most of the
time."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lonely Heights</div>

<p>"The heights are always cold, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and they're supposed to be lonely,
too. Good-night again. Let me know how
you like the book."</p>

<p>Woman-like, she watched him as he went
down the street. She liked the way his head
was set upon his broad shoulders; she admired
his long, swinging stride. When his figure was
lost in the gathering darkness she turned,
regretfully, and went home.</p>

<h2 class="gap3 chaphead"><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<h2 class="chaphead">Brown Alpaca</h2>


<div class="sidenote">A Cheerless Room</div>

<p>At seven o'clock, precisely, Grandmother
Starr limped into the dining-room. It
was one of her "lame" days, though sometimes
she forgot which was her lame side, and limped
irregularly and impartially with either foot,
as chanced to please her erratic fancy.</p>

<p>A small lamp cast a feeble, unshaded light
from the middle of the table, for the morning
was dark, and the room smelled abominably
of oil. The flickering rays picked out here
and there a bit of tarnished gold from the wall
paper, and, as though purposely, made the
worn spots in the carpet unusually distinct.
Meaningless china ornaments crowded the
mantel, but there was no saving grace of
firelight in the small black cavern beneath.
A little stove, in one corner of the room,
smoked industriously and refused to give
out any heat.</p>

<p>"Rosemary," said Grandmother Starr, fretfully,
"I don't see why you can't never learn to
build a fire. Get me my shoulder shawl."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cold and Cross</div>

<p>The girl compressed her pale lips into a thin,
tight line. She was tired and her head ached,
but she said nothing. She found the shawl, of
red-and-black plaid, and spread it over the
old lady's shoulders.</p>

<p>"I didn't say for you to put it on," remarked
Grandmother, sourly. "If I'd wanted you to
put it on me, I'd have said so. Guess I
ain't so old yet but what I can put on my own
shawl. What I want it for is to wrap up my
hands in."</p>

<p>"Where's my shawl?" demanded Aunt
Matilda, entering the room at that moment.</p>

<p>Rosemary found the other shawl, of blue-and-brown
plaid, and silently offered it to the
owner.</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda inclined her grey head toward
Rosemary. "You can put it on me if you like.
I ain't ashamed to say I'm cold when I am,
and if I wanted to wrap up my hands, I'd
get my mittens&mdash;I wouldn't take a whole
shawl."</p>

<p>"You ain't got no reason to be cold, as I
see," remarked Grandmother, sharply. "Folks
what lays abed till almost seven o'clock ought
to be nice and warm unless they're lazy.
P'r'aps if you moved around more, your blood
would warm you."</p>

<p>"Better try it," Matilda suggested, pointedly.</p>

<p>An angry flush mounted to Grandmother's
temples, where the thin white hair was drawn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
back so tightly that it must have hurt. "I've
moved around some in my day," she responded,
shrilly, "but I never got any thanks for it.
What with sweepin' and dustin' and scrubbin'
and washin' and ironin' and bringin' up children
and feedin' pigs and cows and chickens and
churnin' and waitin' on your father, it's no
wonder I'm a helpless cripple with the misery
in my back."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Head of the House</div>

<p>"Dried peaches again," Matilda observed,
scornfully, as Rosemary put a small saucer of
fruit before her. "Who told you to get dried
peaches?"</p>

<p>"I did, if you want to know," Grandmother
snorted. "This is my house, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"I've heard tell that it was," Matilda
answered, "and I'm beginnin' to believe it."</p>

<p>Miss Matilda was forty-six, but, in the pitiless
glare of the odorous lamp, she looked much
older. Her hair was grey and of uneven
length, so that short, straight hair continually
hung about her face, without even the saving
grace of fluffiness. Her eyes were steel-blue and
cold, her nose large and her mouth large also.
Her lips drooped at the corners and there was
a wart upon her chin.</p>

<p>Grandmother also had a wart, but it was upon
her nose. Being a friendly and capable sort
of wart, it held her steel-bowed spectacles at the
proper angle for reading or knitting. During
conversation, she peered over her spectacles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and sometimes, to the discomfort of a sensitive
observer, the steel frame appeared to divide
her eyes horizontally.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All Wrong</div>

<p>They were very dark, beady eyes, set close together.
At times they gleamed with the joy
of conflict, but they always expressed a certain
malicious cunning. With a single glance, she
could make Rosemary feel mentally undressed.
Had the girl's forehead been transparent,
like the crystal of a watch, with the machinery
of thought and emotion fully exposed to the
eye of a master-mechanic, her sensation could
not have differed from the helpless awe her
grandmother so easily inspired.</p>

<p>Of course the breakfast was not right&mdash;it
never was. The dried peaches were too sweet
for one and not sweet enough for the other.
Grandmother wanted her oatmeal cooked
to a paste, but Aunt Matilda, whose teeth
were better, desired something that must be
chewed before it was swallowed, and unhesitatingly
said so. The coffee was fated to
please neither, though, as Rosemary found
courage to say, you couldn't expect good
coffee on Friday when the same grounds had
been used ever since Sunday morning.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what makes you so
high and mighty all of a sudden," said Grandmother.
"Coffee's just like tea&mdash;as long as
colour comes into it when it's boiled, it's good.
My mother always used the same grounds for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
a week for a family of eight, and she didn't
hear no complaints, neither. You ain't boiled
this long enough&mdash;that's what's the matter."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Common Task</div>

<p>Aunt Matilda muttered something about
"beggars being choosers," and Rosemary
pushed her plate away wearily. She had not
tasted her breakfast.</p>

<p>Grandmother arose and noisily blew out the
lamp, regardless of the fact that Matilda had
not finished eating. "Now, Rosemary," she
said, briskly, "after you get the dishes done
and the kitchen cleaned up, I want you should
go to the post-office and get my paper. When
you come back, you can do the sweepin' and
dustin' down here and I can set in the kitchen
while you're doin' it. Then you can make
the beds and do the up-stairs work and then go
to the store. By the time you're ready to go
to the store, I'll have decided what you're to
get."</p>

<p>"And," continued Aunt Matilda, pushing
back her chair, "this afternoon you can help
me cut out some underclothes and get 'em
basted together." She never attempted any
sort of housework, being pathetically vain of
her one beauty&mdash;her small, white hands. Even
the family sewing she did under protest.</p>

<p>"Is the alpaca all gone?" asked Grandmother.</p>

<p>"Yes," Matilda replied. "I used the last
of it patchin' Rosemary's dress under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
arms. It beats all how hard she is on her
clothes."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Question of Colour</div>

<p>"I'll have to order more," sighed the old
lady. "I suppose the price has gone up
again."</p>

<p>Rosemary's breath came and went quickly;
her heart fluttered with a sudden wildness.
"Grandmother," she pleaded, hesitatingly,
"oh, Aunt Matilda&mdash;just for this once, couldn't
I have grey alpaca instead of brown? I hate
brown so!"</p>

<p>Both women stared at her as though she
had all at once gone mad. The silence became
intense, painful.</p>

<p>"I mean," faltered the girl, "if it's the
same price. I wouldn't ask you to pay any
more. Perhaps grey might be cheaper now&mdash;even
cheaper than brown!"</p>

<p>"I was married in brown alpaca," said
Grandmother. She used the tone in which
royalty may possibly allude to coronation.</p>

<p>"I was wearing brown alpaca," observed
Aunt Matilda, "the night the minister came
to call."</p>

<p>"Made just like this," they said, together.</p>

<p>"If brown alpaca's good enough for weddin's
and ministers, I reckon it'll do for orphans
that don't half earn their keep," resumed
Grandmother, with her keen eyes fixed upon
Rosemary.</p>

<p>"What put the notion into your head?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
queried Aunt Matilda, with the air of one
athirst for knowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Surprise Party</div>

<p>"Why&mdash;nothing," the girl stammered, "except
that&mdash;when I was looking at mother's
things the other day, up in the attic, I found
some pink ribbon, and I thought it would be
pretty with grey, and if I had a grey dress&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The other two exchanged glances. "Ain't
it wonderful," asked Matilda of her mother,
"how blood will tell?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is," responded Grandmother,
polishing her spectacles vigorously with a
corner of the plaid shawl. "Your ma," she
went on, to Rosemary, "was wearin' grey when
your pa brought her here to visit us. They
was a surprise party&mdash;both of 'em. We
didn't even know he was plannin' marriage
and I don't believe he was, either. We've
always thought your ma roped him into it,
somehow."</p>

<p>Rosemary's eyes filled with mist and she bit
her lips.</p>

<p>"She was wearin' grey," continued Aunt
Matilda; "light grey that would show every
spot. I told her it wasn't a very serviceable
colour and she had the impudence to laugh at
me. 'It'll clean, won't it?' she says, just
like that, and Frank says, right after her, 'Yes,
it'll clean.' He knew a lot about it, he did.
She had psychologised him."</p>

<p>"You mean hypnotised," interrupted Grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>mother.
"There ain't no such word as
'psychologised.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Resentment</div>

<p>"Well, if there ain't, there ought to be."</p>

<p>"The pink has come out in the blood, too,"
Grandmother remarked, adjusting her spectacles
firmly upon the ever-useful and unfailing
wart. "She was wearin' pink roses on her
bonnet and pink ribbon strings. It wouldn't
surprise me if it was the very strings what
Rosemary has found in the trunk and is layin'
out to wear."</p>

<p>"Me neither," Matilda chimed in.</p>

<p>"She was wearin' lace on her petticoats and
high-heeled shoes, and all her handkerchiefs
was fine linen," Grandmother continued.
"Maybe you'd like some lace ruffles under
your grey alpaca, wouldn't you, Rosemary?"</p>

<p>The girl got to her feet blindly. She gathered
up the dishes with cold hands that
trembled, took them out into the kitchen, and
noiselessly closed the door. Her heart was
hot with resentment, even though she had
heard the story, with variations, ever since
she was old enough to understand it.</p>

<p>"Poor little mother," said Rosemary, to
herself. "Dear little mother! Why couldn't
you have taken me with you!"</p>

<p>As Grandmother had said, for the hundredth
time and more, Frank Starr had brought home
his young wife unexpectedly. The surprise,
in itself, was a shock from which she and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Matilda had never recovered. Even now,
they were fond of alluding to the years of ill-health
directly caused by it, and of subtly
blaming Rosemary for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Orphan</div>

<p>At the end of the third day, the young couple
had departed hastily, the bride in tears. A
year or so afterward, when Rosemary was
born, the little mother died, having lived only
long enough to ask that the baby be named
"Rosemary"&mdash;Rose for her own mother and
Mary for Grandmother Starr.</p>

<p>Stern, white-faced, and broken-hearted,
Frank Starr brought his child to his mother
and sister, and almost immediately went West.
Intermittently he wrote briefly, sent money,
gave insufficient addresses, or none at all, and,
at length, disappeared. At the time his last
letter was written, he had expected to take a
certain steamer plying along the Western
coast. As the ship was wrecked and he was
never heard from again, it seemed that Rosemary
was an orphan, dependent upon her
grandmother and aunt.</p>

<p>In their way, they were kind to her. She
was sent to school regularly, and had plenty
to eat and wear, of a certain sort. Every
Spring, Aunt Matilda made the year's supply
of underclothing, using for the purpose coarse,
unbleached muslin, thriftily purchased by the
bolt. The brown alpaca and brown gingham,
in which she and her grandmother and aunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
had been dressed ever since she could remember,
were also bought by the piece. The
fashion of the garments had not changed, for
one way of making a gown was held to be as
good as another, and a great deal easier, if the
maker were accustomed to doing it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Year after Year</div>

<p>So, year after year, Rosemary wore full
skirts of brown alpaca, gathered into a band,
and tight-fitting waists, boned and lined, buttoning
down the front with a row of small jet
buttons. The sleeves were always long, plain,
and tight, no matter what other people were
wearing. A bit of cheap lace gathered at the
top of the collar was the only attempt at
adornment.</p>

<p>The brown ginghams were made in the same
way, except that the waists were not boned.
The cheap white muslin, which served as Rosemary's
best Summer gown, was made like the
ginghams. Her Winter hat was brown felt,
trimmed with brown ribbon, her Summer hat
was brown straw, trimmed with brown ribbon,
and her Winter coat was also brown, of some
heavy material which wore surpassingly well.</p>

<p>For years her beauty-loving soul had been
in revolt, but never before had she dared to
suggest a change. The lump in her throat
choked her as she washed the dishes, heedless
of the tears that fell into the dish-pan. But
activity is a sovereign remedy for the blues,
and by the time the kitchen was made spotless,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
she had recovered her composure. She washed
her face in cold water, dusted her red eyes with
a bit of corn-starch, and put the cups and plates
in their proper places.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Toiling Cheerfully</div>

<p>She listened half-fearfully for a moment
before she opened the door, dreading to hear
the dear memory of her mother still under discussion,
but Grandmother and Aunt Matilda
were wrangling happily over the hair-wreath in
the parlour. This was a fruitful source of
argument when all other subjects had failed,
for Grandmother insisted that the yellow rose
in the centre was made from the golden curls
of Uncle Henry Underwood's oldest boy,
while Aunt Matilda was equally certain that
it had come from Sarah Starr's second daughter
by her first husband.</p>

<p>Throughout the day Rosemary toiled cheerfully.
She swept, dusted, scrubbed, cooked,
did errands, mailed the letter which made certain
another bolt of brown alpaca, built fires,
and, in the afternoon, brought down the heavy
roll of unbleached muslin from the attic.
Aunt Matilda cleared off the dining-room
table, got out the worn newspaper patterns,
and had sent Rosemary out for a paper of pins
before she remembered that it was Friday, and
that no new task begun on a Friday could ever
be a success.</p>

<p>So, while Rosemary set the table for supper,
the other two harked back to the fateful day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
when Frank Starr brought his wife home.
They were in the next room, but their shrill
voices carried well and Rosemary heard every
word, though she earnestly wished that she
need not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Lucky Friday</div>

<p>"It was Friday, too, if you'll remember,
when Frank brought her," said Aunt Matilda,
indicating Rosemary by an inclination of her
untidy head.</p>

<p>"Then you can't say Friday's always
unlucky," commented Grandmother. "It may
have been bad for us but it was good for her.
Supposin' that butterfly had had her to bring
up&mdash;what'd she have been by now?"</p>

<p>"She resembles her ma some," answered
Matilda, irrelevantly; "at least she would if
she was pretty. She's got the same look
about her, somehow."</p>

<p>"I never thought her ma was pretty. It
was always a mystery to me what Frank saw
in her."</p>

<p>"Come to supper," called Rosemary,
abruptly. She was unable to bear more.</p>

<p>The meal was unexpectedly enlivened by
Grandmother's discovery of a well-soaked
milk ticket in the pitcher. From the weekly
issue of <i>The Household Guardian</i>, which had
reached her that day, she had absorbed a vast
amount of knowledge pertaining to the manners
and customs of germs, and began to fear
for her life. At first, it was thought to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Rosemary's fault, but upon recalling that for
many years the ticket had always been left in
the pitcher, the blame was shifted to the hapless
milkman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At the Close of the Day</div>

<p>Some discussion ensued as to what should
be said to the milkman and who should say it,
but Rosemary observed, with more or less
reason, that if his attention was called to the
error, he might want another ticket. At length
it was decided to say nothing, and Grandmother
personally assumed charge of the ticket, putting
it to dry between newspapers in the hope
of using it again.</p>

<p>After supper, Rosemary washed the dishes,
set the table for breakfast, and sat quietly,
with her hands folded, until the others were
ready to go to bed. She wrapped a hot brick
in red flannel for each of them, put out the
lamp, and followed them up-stairs. Rejoicing
in the shelter afforded by a closed door, she
sat in the dark, shivering a little, until sounds
suggestive of deep slumber came from the two
rooms beyond.</p>

<p>Then she lighted the two candles that Alden
Marsh had given her, and hurriedly undressed,
pausing only to make a wry face at her unbleached
muslin nightgown, entirely without
trimming. She brushed her hair with a worn
brush, braided it, tied it with a bit of shoestring,
and climbed into bed.</p>

<p>After assuring herself of the best light pos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>sible,
she unwrapped the little red book he had
given her a few days before, and began to read,
eagerly, one of the two wonderful sonnet
sequences of which the English language
boasts:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Love's throne was not with these; but far above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All passionate wind of welcome and farewell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He sat in breathless bowers they dream not of;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Upon the Heights</div>

<p>As by magic, the cares of the common day
slipped away from her and her spirit began to
breathe. Upon the heights she walked firmly
now, and as surely as though she felt the hills
themselves beneath her feet.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Born with her life, creature of poignant thirst<br /></span>

<p>The divine melody of the words stirred her
to the depths of her soul. Hunger and thirst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
ran riot in her blood; her heart surged with the
fulness of its tides.</p>

<p>Rosemary put the book aside with shaking
hands. "I wonder," she thought, "how it
would be if anyone should kiss me. Me," she
whispered; "not the women in the books, but
the real me."</p>

<p>The book slipped to the floor unheeded.
She sat there in her ugly nightgown, yearning
with every fibre of her for the unknown joy.
The flickering light of the candles was answered
by the strange fire that burned in her eyes.
At last her head drooped forward and, blind
with tears, she hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear God in Heaven," she prayed, passionately.
"Open the door of the House of
Life to me! Send someone to love me and to
take me away, for Christ's sake&mdash;Amen!"</p>

<h2 class="chaphead">The Crystal Ball</h2>


<div class="sidenote">A Function</div>

<p>"Am I late, Lady Mother?"</p>

<p>Madame Marsh turned toward Alden
with a smile. "Only five minutes, and it
doesn't matter, since it's Saturday."</p>

<p>"Five minutes," he repeated. "Some clever
person once said that those who are five minutes
late do more to upset the order of the
universe than all the anarchists."</p>

<p>Madame's white hands fluttered out over
the silver coffee service. "One lump or
two?" she inquired, with the sugar-tongs
poised over his cup.</p>

<p>"Two, please."</p>

<p>Of course she knew, but she liked to ask.
She had been at the table, waiting for him,
since the grandfather's clock in the hall struck
eight.</p>

<p>In the old house on the shore of the river,
breakfast was a function, luncheon a mild
festivity, and dinner an affair of high state.
Madame herself always appeared at dinner
suitably clad, and, moreover, insisted upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
evening clothes for her son. Once, years ago,
he had protested at the formality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Magic of Sunlight</div>

<p>"Why not?" she had queried coldly. "Shall
we not be as civilised as we can?" And, again,
when he had presented himself at the dinner
hour in the serviceable garb of every day, she
had refused to go to the table until he came
down again, "dressed as a gentleman should
be dressed after six o'clock."</p>

<p>The sunlight streamed into every nook and
cranny of the room where they sat at breakfast.
It lighted up the polished surfaces of old
mahogany, woke forgotten gleams from the
worn old silver, and summoned stray bits of
iridescence from the prisms that hung from
the heavy gilt chandeliers.</p>

<p>With less graciousness, it revealed several
places on the frame of the mirror over the
mantel, where the gold had fallen away and
had been replaced by an inferior sort of gilding.
By some subtle trickery with the lace curtain
that hung at the open window, it laid an arabesque
of delicate shadow upon the polished
floor. In the room beyond, where Madame's
crystal ball lay on the mahogany table, with a
bit of black velvet beneath it, the sun had
made a living rainbow that carried colour and
light into the hall and even up the stairway.</p>

<p>As she sat with her back to it, the light was
scarcely less gentle with Madame. It brought
silver into her white hair, shimmered along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
silken surface of her grey gown, and deepened
the violet shadows in her eyes. It threw into
vivid relief the cameo that fastened the lace
at her throat, rested for a moment upon the
mellow gold of her worn wedding-ring as she
filled Alden's cup, and paused reminiscently
at the corner of her mouth, where there had
once been a dimple.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tales of a Mirror</div>

<p>Across the table, the light shone full upon
Alden's face, but, man-like, he had no fear of
it. Madame noted, with loving approval, how
it illumined the dark depths of his eyes and
showed the strength of his firm, boyish chin.
Each day, to her, he grew more like his father.</p>

<p>"A penny for your thoughts," he said.</p>

<p>Madame sighed. "It seems so strange,"
she replied, after a pensive interval, "that I
should be old and you should be young. You
look so much like your father sometimes that
it is as though the clock had turned back for
him and I had gone on. You're older now
than he was when we were married, but I
need my mirror to remind me that I'm past
my twenties."</p>

<p>"A woman and her mirror," laughed Alden,
helping himself to a crisp muffin. "What tales
each might tell of the other, if they would!"</p>

<p>"Don't misunderstand me, dear," she said,
quickly. "It's not that I mind growing old.
I've never been the unhappy sort of woman
who desires to keep the year for ever at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Spring. Each season has its own beauty&mdash;its
own charm. We would tire of violets and
apple-blossoms if they lasted always. Impermanence
is the very essence of joy&mdash;the drop
of bitterness that enables one to perceive the
sweet."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Over the Breakfast Cups</div>

<p>"All of which is undoubtedly true," he
returned, gallantly, "but the fact remains that
you're not old and never will be. You're
merely a girl who has powdered her hair for a
fancy-dress ball."</p>

<p>"Flatterer!" she said, with affected severity,
but the delicate pink flush that bloomed in her
cheeks showed that she was pleased.</p>

<p>"Will you drive to-day?" he asked, as they
rose from the table.</p>

<p>"I think not. I'm a hot-house plant, you
know, and it seems cold outside."</p>

<p>"Have the new books come yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they came yesterday, but I haven't
opened the parcel."</p>

<p>"I hope they won't prove as disappointing
as the last lot. There wasn't a thing I could
ask Rosemary to read. I'm continually falling
back on the old ones."</p>

<p>"The old books are the best, after all, like
the old friends and the old ways."</p>

<p>Alden walked around the room restlessly,
his hands in his pockets. At length he paused
before the window overlooking the vineyard,
on the other side of the valley. The slope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
was bare of snow, now; the vines waited the
call of Spring.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alden's Revolt</div>

<p>A soft footfall sounded beside him, then his
mother put a caressing hand upon his shoulder.
"It's almost time to begin, isn't it?" she
asked. Her beautiful old face was radiant.</p>

<p>Impatiently, he shook himself free from her
touch. "Mother," he began, "let's have it
out once for all. I can't stand this any longer."</p>

<p>She sank into the nearest chair, with all the
life suddenly gone from her face and figure.
In a moment she had grown old, but presently,
with an effort, she regained her self-command.
"Yes?" she returned, quietly. "What do you
wish to do?"</p>

<p>"Anything," he answered, abruptly&mdash;"anything
but this. I want to get out where I can
breathe, where the sky fits the ground as far as
you can see&mdash;where it isn't eternally broken
into by these everlasting hills. I'd like to
know that dinner wouldn't always be ready
at seven o'clock&mdash;in fact, I'd like sometimes
not to have any dinner at all. I want to get
forty miles from a schoolhouse and two hundred
miles from a grape. I never want to see
another grape as long as I live."</p>

<p>He knew that he was hurting her, but his
insurgent youth demanded its right of speech
after long repression. "I'm a man," he cried,
"and I want to do a man's work in the world
and take a man's place. Just because my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
ancestors chose to slave in a treadmill, I don't
have to stay in it, do I? You have no right
to keep me chained up here!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Released</div>

<p>The clock ticked loudly in the hall, the canary
hopped noisily about his cage and chirped
shrilly. A passing breeze came through the
open window and tinkled the prisms that hung
from the chandelier. It sounded like the echo
of some far-away bell.</p>

<p>"No," said Madame, dully. "As you say,
I have no right to keep you chained up here."</p>

<p>"Mother!" he cried, with swift remorse.
"Don't misunderstand me!"</p>

<p>She raised her hand and motioned him to
the chair opposite. "Your language is sufficiently
explicit," she went on, clearing her
throat. "There is no chance for anyone to
misunderstand you. I am very sorry that I&mdash;I
have not seen, that you have been obliged
to ask for release from an&mdash;unpleasant&mdash;position.
Go&mdash;whenever you choose."</p>

<p>He stared at her for a moment, uncomprehending.
"Mother! Oh, Mother!" he whispered.
"Do you really mean it? Where shall
we go?"</p>

<p>"'We,'" she repeated. "Now I do misunderstand
you."</p>

<p>"Why, Mother! What do you mean? Of
course we shall go together!"</p>

<p>Madame rose from her chair, with some
difficulty. "You have said," she went on,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
choosing her words carefully, "that I had no
right to keep you chained up here. I admit
it&mdash;I have not. Equally, you have no right to
uproot me."</p>

<div class="sidenote">One's Own Choice</div>

<p>"But, Mother! Why, I couldn't go without
you, and leave you alone. We belong together,
you and I!"</p>

<p>The hard lines of her mouth relaxed, ever so
little, but her eyes were very dark and stern.
"As much as we belong together," she resumed,
"we belong here. Dead hands built this house,
dead hands laid out that vineyard, dead hands
have given us our work. If we fail, we betray
the trust of those who have gone before us&mdash;we
have nothing to give to those who come.</p>

<p>"I've seen," she continued, with rising
passion. "You were determined from the
first to fail!"</p>

<p>"Fail!" he echoed, with lips that scarcely
moved.</p>

<p>"Yes, for no man fails except by his own
choice. You might have been master of the
vineyard, but you have preferred to have the
vineyard master you. Confronted with an
uncongenial task, you slunk away from it and
shielded yourself behind the sophistry that the
work was unworthy of you. As if any work
were unworthy of a man!"</p>

<p>"I hate it," he murmured, resentfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, just as people hate their superiors.
You hate it because you can't do it. Year by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
year, I have seen the crop grow less and less;
year by year I have seen our income decreasing.
We are living now on less than half of what we
had when you took charge of the vineyard.
Last year the grapes were so poor that I was
ashamed to use them for wine. And to think,"
she flashed at him, bitterly, "that the name of
Marsh used to stand for quality! What does
it mean now? Nothing&mdash;thanks to you!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Name of Marsh</div>

<p>The dull red rose to his temples and he
cringed visibly. "I&mdash;I&mdash;" he stammered.</p>

<p>"One moment, please, and then I shall say
no more. This is between you and your own
manhood, not between you and your mother.
I put no obstacles in your path&mdash;you may go
when and where you choose. I only ask you
to remember that a man who has failed to do
the work that lies nearest his hand is not
likely to succeed at anything else.</p>

<p>"It is not for you to say whether or not
anything is worthy when it has once been given
you to do. You have only to do it and make
it worthy by the doing. When you have
proved yourself capable, another task will be
given you, but not before. You hate the
vineyard because you cannot raise good
grapes, you hate to teach school because you
cannot teach school well. You want to find
something easy to do&mdash;something that will
require no effort."</p>

<p>"No," he interrupted, "you're mistaken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
there. I want to do something great&mdash;I'm
not asking for anything easy."</p>

<div class="sidenote">"I Belong Here"</div>

<p>"Greatness comes slowly," she answered,
her voice softening a little, "and by difficult
steps&mdash;not by leaps and bounds. You must
learn the multiplication table before you can
be an astronomer. None the less, it is your
right to choose."</p>

<p>"Then, granting that, why wouldn't you
come with me?"</p>

<p>"Because it is also my right to choose for
myself and I belong here. When I identified
myself with the Marsh family, I did it in good
faith. When I was married, I came here, my
children were born here, your father and
brother and sister died here, and I shall die
here too. When you go, I shall do my best
with the vineyard."</p>

<p>She spoke valiantly, but there was a pathetic
little quiver in her lips as she said the last
words. Alden stood at the window, contemplating
the broad acres bordered with pine.</p>

<p>"Do not say <i>when</i> I go, Mother&mdash;say <i>if</i> I go."</p>

<p>"I thought you had decided," she murmured,
but her heart began to beat quickly, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't, but I'll decide in the course
of the day. Good-bye for the present."</p>

<p>He stooped, kissed the cheek she turned to
him, and went out, assuming a cheerfulness
he did not feel. Madame leaned back in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
chair with her eyes closed, exhausted by the
stress of emotion. The maid came in for
orders, she gave them mechanically, then went
into the living-room. She was anxious to be
alone, but felt unequal to the exertion of
climbing the stairs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pictured Face</div>

<p>As the hours passed, she slowly regained
her composure. It seemed impossible that
Alden should go away and leave her when they
two were alone in the world, and, as he said,
belonged together. More than ever that morning
had he looked like his father.</p>

<p>Old memories crowded thickly upon her as
she sat there. Bits of her childhood flashed
back at her out of the eternal stillness, "even
as the beads of a told rosary." Since the day
she met Alden's father, everything was clear
and distinct, for, with women, life begins with
love and the rest is as though it had never been.</p>

<p>An old daguerreotype was close at hand in a
table drawer. She opened the ornate case
tenderly, brushed the blue velvet that lined it,
and kissed the pictured face behind the glass.
So much had they borne together, so much
had they loved, and all was gone&mdash;save this!</p>

<p>The serene eyes, for ever youthful, looked
back at her across the years. Except for the
quaint, old-fashioned look inseparable from
an old picture, the face was that of the boy
who had left her a few hours ago. The deep,
dark eyes, the regular features, the firm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
straight chin, the lovable mouth, the adorable
boyishness&mdash;all were there, shut in by blue
velvet and glass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Man She Loved</div>

<p>Madame smiled as she sat there looking at
it. She had always had her way with the
father&mdash;why should she doubt her power over
the son? Supremely maternal as she was, the
sheltering instinct had extended even to the
man she loved. He had been outwardly
strong and self-confident, assured, self-reliant,
even severe with others, but behind the bold
exterior, as always to the eyes of the beloved
woman, had been a little, shrinking, helpless
child, craving the comfort of a woman's hand&mdash;the
sanctuary of a woman's breast.</p>

<p>Even in her own hours of stress and trial,
she had feared to lean upon him too much,
knowing how surely he depended upon her.
He was more than forty when he died, yet to
her he had been as one of her children, though
infinitely dearer than any child could be.</p>

<p>The quick tears started at the thought of
the children, for the childish prattle had so
soon been hushed, the eager little feet had been
so quickly stilled. Alden was the first-born
son, with an older daughter, who had been
named Virginia, for her mother. Virginia
would have been thirty-two now, and probably
married, with children of her own. The
second son would have been twenty-eight, and,
possibly, married also. There might have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
been a son-in-law, a daughter-in-law, and three
or four children by this time, had these two
lived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The House of Memories</div>

<p>So, through the House of Memories her
fancy sped, as though borne on wings. Childish
voices rang through the empty corridors
and the fairy patter of tiny feet sounded on the
stairs. One by one, out of the shadows, old
joys and old loves came toward her; forgotten
hopes and lost dreams. Hands long
since mingled with the dust clasped hers once
more with perfect understanding&mdash;warm lips
were crushed upon hers with the old ecstasy
and the old thrill. Even the sorrows, from
which the bitterness had strangely vanished,
came back out of the darkness, not with hesitancy,
but with assurance, as though already
welcomed by a friend.</p>

<p>Alden did not come home to luncheon, so
Madame made only a pretence of eating. As
the long afternoon wore away, she reproached
herself bitterly for her harshness. There had
been pain in the boy's eyes when he bent to
kiss her&mdash;and she had turned her cheek.</p>

<p>She would have faced any sort of privation
for this one beloved son&mdash;the only gift Life had
not as yet taken back. Perhaps, after all, he
knew best, for have not men led and women
followed since, back in Paradise, the First
Woman gave her hand trustingly to the First
Man?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Visions in the Crystal Ball</div>

<p>Long, slanting sunbeams, alight with the
gold of afternoon, came into the room by
another window, and chanced upon the crystal
ball. Madame's face grew thoughtful. "I
wonder," she mused, "if I dare to try!"</p>

<p>She was half afraid of her own sorcery, because,
so many times, that which she had seen
had come true. Once, when a child was ill,
she had gazed into the crystal and seen the
little white coffin that, a week later, was carried
out of the front door. Again, she had seen the
vision of a wedding which was unexpectedly
fulfilled later, when a passing cousin begged
the hospitality of her house for a marriage.</p>

<p>She drew her chair up to the table, made
sure of the proper light, and leaned over the
ball. For a time there was darkness, then
confused images that meant nothing, then at
last, clear and distinct as a flash of lightning,
her own son, holding a woman in his arms.</p>

<p>Madame pushed the ball aside, profoundly
disturbed. Was the solution of their problem,
then, to come in that way? And who was the
woman?</p>

<p>In the dazzling glimpse she had caught no
detail save a shimmering white gown and her
son's face half hidden by the masses of the
woman's hair. A faint memory of the hair
persisted; she had never seen anything quite
like it. Was it brown, or golden, or&mdash;perhaps
red? Yes, red&mdash;that was it, and in all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
circle of their acquaintance there was no
woman with red hair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alden's Decision</div>

<p>It was evident, then, that he was going
away. Very well, she would go too. And
when Alden had found his woman with the
red hair, she would come back, alone&mdash;of course
they would not want her.</p>

<p>She felt suddenly lonely, as though she had
lived too long. For the first time, she forgot
to light the candles on the mantel when the
room became too dark to see. She had sat
alone in the darkness for some time when she
heard Alden's step outside.</p>

<p>When he came in, he missed the accustomed
lights. "Mother!" he called, vaguely alarmed.
Then, again: "Mother! Where are you,
Mother dear?"</p>

<p>"I'm here," she responded, rising from her
chair and fumbling along the mantel-shelf for
matches. "I'm sorry I forgot the candles."
The mere sound of his voice had made her
heart leap with joy.</p>

<p>He was muddy and tired and his face was
very white. "I know it's late," he said,
apologetically, "and I'll go up to dress right
now. I&mdash;I've decided to&mdash;stay."</p>

<p>His voice broke a little on the last word.
Madame drew his tall head down and kissed
him, forgetting all about the crystal ball.
"For your own sake?" she asked; "or for
mine?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">An Unfair Advantage</div>

<p>"For yours, of course. I'll try to do as
you want me to, Lady Mother. I have nothing
to do but to make you happy."</p>

<p>For answer, she kissed him again. "I must
dress, too," she said.</p>

<p>When they met at dinner, half an hour later,
neither made any reference to the subject that
had been under discussion. Outwardly all
was calm and peaceful, as deep-flowing waters
may hide the rocks beneath. By the time
coffee was served, they were back upon the old
footing of affectionate comradeship.</p>

<p>Afterward, he read the paper while Madame
played solitaire. When she turned the queen
of hearts, she remembered the red-haired
woman whom she had seen in the crystal ball.
And they were not going away, after all!
Madame felt that she had in some way gained
an unfair advantage over the red-haired
woman. There would be no one, now, to take
her boy away from her.</p>

<p>And yet, when the time came for her to go,
would she want Alden to live on in the old
house alone, looking after the hated vineyard
and teaching the despised school? At best, it
could be only a few years more.</p>

<p>Feeling her grave, sweet eyes upon him,
Alden looked up from his paper. "What is it,
Mother?"</p>

<p>"Dear," she said, thoughtfully, "I want
you to marry and bring me a daughter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
I want to hold your son in my arms before I
die."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Madame's Dream</div>

<p>"Rather a large order, isn't it?" He
laughed indifferently, and went on with his
reading. Madame laughed, too, as she continued
her solitaire, but, none the less, she
dreamed that night that the house was full of
women with red hair, and that each one was
gazing earnestly into the depths of a crystal
ball.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Joy
of
Morning</div>

<p>With a rush of warm winds and a tinkle
of raindrops, Spring danced over the
hills. The river stirred beneath the drifting
ice, then woke into musical murmuring. Even
the dead reeds and dry rushes at the bend
of the stream gave forth a faint melody when
swayed by the full waters beneath.</p>

<p>The joy of morning was abroad in the
world. Robins sang it, winds whispered it,
and, beneath the sod, every fibre of root and
tree quivered with aspiration, groping through
the labyrinth of darkness with a blind impulse
toward the light. Across the valley, on the
southern slope, a faint glow of green seemed to
hover above the dark tangle of the vineyard,
like some indefinite suggestion of colour, promising
the sure beauty yet to come.</p>

<p>Rosemary had climbed the Hill of the
Muses early in the afternoon. She, too, was
awake, in every fibre of body and soul.
Springs had come and gone before&mdash;twenty-five
of them&mdash;but she had never known one
like this. A vague delight possessed her, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
her heart throbbed as from imprisoned wings.
Purpose and uplift and aspiration swayed her
strangely; she yearned blindly toward some
unknown goal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Family
Religion</div>

<p>She had not seen Alden for a long time.
The melting ice and snow had made the hill
unpleasant, if not impossible, and the annual
sewing had kept her closely indoors. She and
Aunt Matilda had made the year's supply of
underwear from the unbleached muslin, and
one garment for each from the bolt of brown-and-white
gingham. Rosemary disdained to
say "gown" or even "dress," for the result of
her labour was a garment, simply, and nothing
more.</p>

<p>Every third Summer she had a new white
muslin, of the cheapest quality, which she
wore to church whenever it was ordained that
she should go. Grandmother and Aunt Matilda
were deeply religious, but not according to any
popular plan. They had their own private
path to Heaven, and had done their best to set
Rosemary's feet firmly upon it, but with small
success.</p>

<p>When she was a child, Rosemary had spent
many long, desolate Sunday afternoons thinking
how lonely it would be in Heaven with
nobody there but God and the angels and the
Starr family. Even the family, it seemed, was
not to be admitted as an entity, but separately,
according to individual merit. Grandmother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and Aunt Matilda had many a wordy battle as
to who would be there and who wouldn't, but
both were sadly agreed that Frank must stay
outside.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rewards
and
Punishments</div>

<p>Rosemary was deeply hurt when she discovered
that Grandmother did not expect to
meet her son there, and as for her son's wife&mdash;the
old lady had dismissed the hapless bride to
the Abode of the Lost with a single comprehensive
snort. Alternately, Rosemary had
been rewarded for good behaviour by the
promise of Heaven and punished for small misdemeanours
by having the gates closed in her
face. As she grew older and began to think
for herself, she wondered how Grandmother
and Aunt Matilda had obtained their celestial
appointment as gate-keepers, and reflected
that it might possibly be very pleasant outside,
with the father and mother whom she had
never seen.</p>

<p>So, of late years, religion had not disturbed
Rosemary much. She paid no attention to
the pointed allusions to "heathen" and "infidels"
that assailed her ears from time to
time, and ceased to feel her young flesh creep
when the Place of Torment was described with
all the power of two separate and vivid imaginations.
Disobedience troubled her no longer
unless she was found out, and, gradually, she
developed a complicated system of deception.</p>

<p>When she was discovered reading a novel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
she had accepted the inevitable punishment
with outward submission. Naturally, it was
not easy to tear out the leaves one by one,
especially from a borrowed book, and put them
into the fire, saying, each time she put one in:
"I will never read another novel as long as I
live," but she had compelled herself to do it
gracefully. Only her flaming cheeks had
betrayed her real feeling.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forbidden
Reading</div>

<p>A week later, when she was locked in her
room for the entire day, on account of some
slight offence, she had wept so much over the
sorrows of Jane Eyre that even Aunt Matilda
was affected when she brought up the bread
and milk for the captive's supper. Rosemary
had hidden the book under the mattress at the
first sound of approaching footsteps, but Aunt
Matilda, by describing the tears of penitence
to the stern authority below, obtained permission
for Rosemary to come down-stairs, eat her
bread and milk at the table, and, afterward, to
wash the dishes.</p>

<p>She continued to borrow books from the
school library, however, and later from Alden
Marsh. When he learned that she dared not
read at night, for fear of burning too much oil,
he began to supply her with candles. Thus the
world of books was opened to her, and many
a midnight had found her, absorbed and
breathless, straining her eyes over the last
page. More than once she had read all night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and fallen asleep afterward at the breakfast
table.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Occasional Meetings</div>

<p>Once, long ago, Alden had called upon her,
but the evening was made so unpleasant, both
for him and his unhappy hostess, that he never
came again. Rosemary used to go to the
schoolhouse occasionally, to sit and talk for
an hour or so after school, but some keen-eyed
busy-body had told Grandmother and the
innocent joy had come to an abrupt conclusion.
Rosemary kept her promise not to go to the
schoolhouse simply because she dared not
break it.</p>

<p>The windows of the little brown house,
where the Starrs lived, commanded an unobstructed
view of the Marshs' big Colonial porch,
in Winter, when the trees between were bare,
so it was impossible for the girl to go there,
openly, as Mrs. Marsh had never returned Aunt
Matilda's last call.</p>

<p>Sometimes Alden wrote to her, but she was
unable to answer, for stationery and stamps
were unfamiliar possessions; Grandmother held
the purse-strings tightly, and every penny
had to be accounted for. On Thursday,
Rosemary always went to the post-office, as
<i>The Household Guardian</i> was due then, so it
happened that occasionally she received a letter,
or a book which she could not return until
Spring.</p>

<p>At length, the Hill of the Muses became the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
one possible rendezvous, though, at the chosen
hour of four, Rosemary was usually too weary
to attempt the long climb. Moreover, she
must be back by six to get supper, so one little
hour was all she might ever hope for, at a time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Far Above
Her</div>

<p>Yet these hours had become a rosary of
memories to her, jewelled upon the chain of her
uneventful days. Alden's unfailing friendliness
and sympathy warmed her heart, though
she had never thought of him as a possible
lover. In her eyes, he was as far above her as
the fairy prince had been above Cinderella. It
was only kindness that made him stoop at all.</p>

<p>When the school bell, sounding for dismissal,
echoed through the valley below, Rosemary
hung her scarlet signal to the outstanding
bough of the lowest birch, and went back to
the crest of the hill to wait for him. She had
with her the little red book that he had given
her long ago, and which she had not had
opportunity to return.</p>

<p>She turned the pages regretfully, though
she knew the poems almost by heart. Days,
while she washed dishes and scrubbed, the
exquisite melody of the words haunted her,
like some far-off strain of music. For the first
time she had discovered the subtle harmonies
of which the language is capable, entirely apart
from sense.</p>

<p>Living lines stood out upon the printed
page, glowing with a rapture all their own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Thrilling

<span class="i0">"Now, shadowed by his wings, our faces yearn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Together,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>she read aloud, thrilled by the very sound.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Tender as dawn's first hill-fire," ... "What marshalled
marvels on the skirts of May," ... "Shadows
and shoals that edge eternity." ...</p></div>

<p>"Oh," she breathed, "if only I didn't have

</div></div>

<p>"What, indeed?" thought Rosemary.

be?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Up your warm throat to your warm lips: for this" ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Rosemary put the book down, face to face
at last with self-knowledge. She would have
torn down the flaming signal, but it was too
late. If he were coming&mdash;and he never had
failed to come&mdash;he would be there very soon.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Alden had closed his desk with a sigh as the
last pair of restless little feet tumbled down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the schoolhouse steps. Scraps of paper littered
the floor and the room was musty and close in
spite of two open windows. From where he
sat, he could see the vineyard, with its perpetual
demand upon him. Since his painful
interview with his mother, he had shrunk,
inwardly, from even the sight of the vineyard.
It somehow seemed to have a malicious air
about it. Mutely it challenged his manhood,
menaced his soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uneventful
Days</div>

<p>He had accepted the inevitable but had not
ceased to rebel. The coming years stretched
out before him in a procession of grey, uneventful
days. Breakfast, school, luncheon, school,
long evenings spent in reading to his mother,
and, from Spring to frost, the vineyard, with
its multitudinous necessities.</p>

<p>He felt, keenly, that his mother did not quite
understand him. In fact, nobody did, unless
it was Rosemary, whom he had not seen for
weeks. Brave little Rosemary, for whom life
consisted wholly of deprivations! How seldom
she complained and how often she had soothed
his discontent!</p>

<p>It was three years ago that she had come
shyly to the schoolhouse and asked if she might
borrow a book. He had known her, of course,
before that, but had scarcely exchanged a
dozen words with her. When he saw her,
rarely, at church, Grandmother or Aunt Matilda
was always with her, and the Starrs had had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
nothing to do with the Marshs for several
years past, as Mrs. Marsh had been remiss in
her social obligations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Growing
Interest</div>

<p>At first, Rosemary had been purely negative
to him, and he regarded her with kindly indifference.
The girl's personality seemed as
ashen as her hair, as colourless as her face.
Her dull eyes seemed to see nothing, to care
for nothing. Within the last few months he
had begun to wonder whether her cold and
impassive exterior might not be the shield
with which she protected an abnormal sensitiveness.
Now and then he had longed to awaken
the woman who dwelt securely within the
forbidding fortress&mdash;to strike from the flint
some stray gleams of soul.</p>

<p>Of late he had begun to miss her, and, each
afternoon, to look with a little more conscious
eagerness for the scarlet thread on the hill-top
signalling against the grey sky beyond. His
interest in her welfare was becoming more
surely personal, not merely human. During
the Winter, though he had seen her only twice,
he had thought about her a great deal, and
had written to her several times without
expecting an answer.</p>

<p>The iron bars of circumstance which bound
her, had, though less narrowly, imprisoned him
also. It seemed permanent for them both,
and, indeed, the way of escape was even more
definitely closed for Rosemary than for him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A New
Rosemary</div>

<p>He sighed as he rose and brushed the chalk
from his clothes. Through force of habit, he
looked up to the crest of the Hill of the Muses as
he locked the door. The red ribbon fluttered
like an oriflamme against the blue-and-white of
the April sky. His heart quickened its beat a
little as he saw it, and his steps insensibly
hastened as he began to climb the hill.</p>

<p>When he took her hand, with a word of
friendly greeting, he noticed a change in her,
though she had made a valiant effort to recover
her composure. This was a new Rosemary,
with eyes shining and the colour flaming in her
cheeks and lips.</p>

<p>"Spring seems to have come to you, too,"
he said, seating himself on the log beside her.
"How well you look!"</p>

<p>The deep crimson mounted to her temples,
then as swiftly retreated. "Better take down
the ribbon," she suggested, practically.</p>

<p>"I've been watching a long time for this,"
he resumed, as he folded it and restored it to its
place in the hollow tree. "What have you
been doing?"</p>

<p>"All the usual dreary things, to which a
mountain of sewing has been added."</p>

<p>"Is that a new gown?"</p>

<p>She laughed, mirthlessly. "It's as new a
gown as I'll ever have," she returned, trying
to keep her voice even. "My wardrobe consists
of an endless parade of brown alpaca and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
brown gingham garments, all made exactly
alike."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thwarted
on All
Sides</div>

<p>"Like a dozen stage soldiers, marching in
and out, to create the illusion of a procession?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. You know I've never seen
a stage, much less a stage soldier."</p>

<p>Alden's heart softened with pity. He
longed to take Rosemary to town and let her
feast her eyes upon some gorgeous spectacle;
to see her senses run riot, for once, with colour
and light and sound.</p>

<p>"I feel sometimes," she was saying, "as
though I had sold my soul for pretty things in
some previous existence, and was paying the
penalty for it now."</p>

<p>"You love pretty things, don't you?"</p>

<p>She turned brimming eyes toward him.
"Love them?" she repeated, brokenly. "There
aren't words enough to say how much!"</p>

<p>From a fresh point of view he saw her countless
deprivations, binding her, thwarting her,
oppressing her on all sides by continual denial.
His own rebellion against circumstances seemed
weak and unworthy.</p>

<p>"Whenever I think of you," he said, in a different
tone, "I feel ashamed of myself. I have
freedom, of a certain sort, and you've never
had a chance to learn the meaning of the word.
You're dominated, body and soul, by a couple
of old women who haven't discovered, as yet,
that the earth is round and not flat."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Freedom</div>

<p>"My soul isn't bound," returned Rosemary,
softly, "but it would have been, if it hadn't
been for you."</p>

<p>"I? Why, my dear girl, what have I done?"</p>

<p>"Everything. Think of all the books
you've loaned me, all the candles you've
given me&mdash;all the times you've climbed this
steep hill just to talk to me for an hour and give
me new strength to go on."</p>

<p>"It's only selfishness, Rosemary. I knew
you were here and I like to talk to you. Don't
forget that you've meant something to me,
too. Why, you're the only woman I know,
except my mother."</p>

<p>"Your mother is lovely," she returned. "I
wish I could go to see her once in a while. I
like to look at her. Even her voice is different
someway."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother is 'different,'" he agreed, idly.
"It's astonishing, sometimes, how 'different'
she manages to be. We had it out the other
day, about the vineyard, and I'm to stay
here&mdash;all the rest of my life," he concluded
bitterly.</p>

<p>"I don't see why, if you don't want to,"
she answered, half-fearfully. "You're a man,
and men can do as they please."</p>

<p>"It probably seems so to you, but I assure
you it's very far from the truth. I wonder,
now and then, if any of us ever really do as we
please. Freedom is the great gift."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Choosing</div>

<p>"And the great loneliness," she added, after
a pause.</p>

<p>"You may be right," he sighed. "Still,
I'd like to try it for a while. It's the one
thing I'd choose. What would you take, if
you could have anything you wanted?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean for just a little while, or for
always?"</p>

<p>"For always. The one great gift you'd
choose from all that Life has to give."</p>

<p>"I'd take love," she said, in a low tone.
She was not looking at him now, but far across
the valley where the vineyard lay. Her face
was wistful in the half-light; the corners of
her mouth quivered, ever so little.</p>

<p>Alden looked at her, then rubbed his eyes
and looked at her again. In some subtle way
she had changed, or he had, since they last
met. Never before had he thought of her as a
woman; she had been merely another individual
to whom he liked to talk. To-day her
womanhood carried its own appeal. She was
not beautiful and no one would ever think her
so, but she was sweet and wholesome and had
a new, indefinable freshness about her that,
in another woman, would have been called
charm.</p>

<p>It came to him, all at once, that, in some
mysterious way, he and Rosemary belonged
together. They had been born to the same
lot, and must spend all their days in the valley,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
hedged in by the same narrow restrictions.
Even an occasional hour on the Hill of the
Muses was forbidden to her, and constant
scheming was the price she was obliged to
pay for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Book</div>

<p>The restraint chafed and fretted him, for
her as much as for himself. It was absurd
that a girl of twenty-five and a man of thirty
should not have some little independence of
thought and action. The silence persisted
and finally became awkward.</p>

<p>"It's the book," said Rosemary, with a
forced laugh. She was endeavouring to brush
her mood away as though it were an annoying
cobweb. "I've grown foolish over the book."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you liked it," he returned, taking
it from her. "I was sure you would. What
part of it did you like best?"</p>

<p>"All of it. I can't choose, though of course
some of it seems more beautiful than the rest."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know it by heart, now,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Almost."</p>

<p>"Listen. Isn't this like to-day?"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Rosemary got to her feet unsteadily. She
went to the brow of the hill, on the side farthest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
from the vineyard, and stood facing the sunset.
Scarcely knowing that she had moved,
Alden read on:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But April's sun strikes down the glades to-day;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So shut your eyes upturned, and feel my kiss&mdash;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Alden
Speaks</div>

<p>A smothered sob made him look up quickly.
She stood with her back to him, but her
shoulders were shaking. He dropped the
book and went to her.</p>

<p>A strange, new tenderness possessed him.
"Rosemary," he whispered, slipping his arm
around her. "What is it&mdash;dear?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," she sobbed, trying to release
herself. "I'm&mdash;I'm tired&mdash;and foolish&mdash;that's
all. Please let me go!"</p>

<p>Something within him stirred in answer to
the girl's infinite hunger, to the unspoken appeal
that vibrated through her voice. "No,"
he said, with quiet mastery, "I won't let you
go. I want to take care of you, Rosemary.
Leave all that misery and come to me, won't
you?"</p>

<p>Her eyes met his for an instant, then turned
away. "I don't quite&mdash;understand," she said,
with difficulty.</p>

<p>"I'm asking you to marry me&mdash;to come to
mother and me. We'll make the best of it
together."</p>

<p>Her eyes met his clearly now, but her face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
was pale and cold. She was openly incredulous
and frightened.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Her
Birthright</div>

<p>"I mean it, dear. Don't be afraid. Oh,
Rosemary, can't you trust me?"</p>

<p>"Trust you? Yes, a thousand times, yes!"</p>

<p>He drew her closer. "And love me&mdash;a
little?"</p>

<p>"Love you?" The last light shone upon
her face and the colour surged back in waves.
She seemed exalted, transfigured, as by a
radiance that shone from within.</p>

<p>He put his hand under her chin and lifted
her face to his. "Kiss me, won't you, dear?"</p>

<p>And so, Rosemary came to her woman's
birthright, in the shelter of a man's arms.</p>

<h2 class="chaphead">The House of the Broken Heart</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Climbing
in the
Dark</div>

<p>The road was steep and very dark, but
some unseen Power compelled her to
climb. Dimly, through the shadow, she saw
shafts of broken marbles and heard the sound
of slow-falling waters. The desolation oppressed
her, and, as she climbed, she pressed
her hands tightly to her heart.</p>

<p>She was alone in an empty world. All
traces of human occupation had long since
vanished. Brambles and thorns grew thickly
about her, and her brown gingham dress was
torn to shreds. Rosemary shuddered in her
dream, for Grandmother and Aunt Matilda
would be displeased.</p>

<p>And yet, where were they? She had not
seen them since she entered the darkness
below. At first she had been unable to see
anything, for the darkness was not merely
absence of light but had a positive, palpable
quality, it enshrouded her as by heavy folds
of black velvet that suffocated her, but, as she
climbed, the air became lighter and the darkness
less.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Path
in the
Garden</div>

<p>She longed to stop for a few moments and
rest, but the pitiless Power continually urged
her on. Bats fluttered past her and ghostly
wings brushed her face, but, strangely, she
had no fear. As her eyes became accustomed
to the all-encompassing night, she saw into it
for a little distance on either side, but never
ahead.</p>

<p>On the left was a vast, empty garden,
neglected and dead. The hedge that surrounded
it was only a tangled mass of undergrowth,
and the paths were buried and choked
by weeds. The desolate house beyond it
loomed up whitely in the shadow. It was
damp and cold in the garden, but she went in,
mutely obeying the blind force that impelled
her to go.</p>

<p>She struggled up the path that led to the
house, falling once into a mass of thistles that
pricked and stung. The broken marbles, as
she saw now, were statues that had been
placed about the garden and had fallen into
decay. The slow-falling water was a fountain
that still murmured, choked though it was by
the dense undergrowth.</p>

<p>One of the steps that led to the house had
fallen inward, so she put her knee on the one
above that and climbed up. She tested each
step of the long flight carefully before she
trusted herself to it. When she reached the
broad porch, her footsteps echoed strangely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
upon the floor. Each slight sound was caught
up and repeated until it sounded like the
tread of a marching army, vanishing into the
distance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Desolate
House</div>

<p>The heavy door creaked on its hinges when
she opened it. That sound, too, echoed and
re-echoed in rhythmic pulsations that beat
painfully upon her ears, but, after she was
once inside, all the clamour ceased.</p>

<p>She could see clearly now, though it was
still dark. A long, wide stairway wound up
from the hall, and there were two great rooms
upon either side. She turned into the wide
doorway at the right.</p>

<p>Windows, grey with cobwebs, stretched
from floor to ceiling, but very little light came
through them. The wall paper, of indistinguishable
pattern, was partially torn from
the walls and the hanging portions swayed
in the same current of air that waved the
cobwebs. There was no furniture of any description
in the room, except the heavy,
gilt-framed mirror over the mantel. It was
cracked and much of the gilt frame had fallen
away. She went into the next room, then
into the one beyond that, which seemed to
stretch across the back of the house, and so
through the door at the left of the room into
the two on the other side of the house, at the
left of the hall.</p>

<p>In the centre of the largest room was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
small table, upon which rested a small object
covered with a dome-shaped glass shade, precisely
like that which covered the basket of
wax flowers in Grandmother's parlour. Rosemary
went to it with keen interest and leaned
over the table to peer in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Broken
Heart</div>

<p>At first she could see nothing, for the glass
was cloudy. She noted, with a pang of disgust,
that the table-cover was made of brown
alpaca, fringed all around by the fabric itself,
cut unskilfully into shreds with the scissors.
As she looked, the glass slowly cleared.</p>

<p>The small object was heart-shaped and made
of wax in some dull colour half-way between
red and brown. At length she saw that it
was broken and the pieces had been laid
together, carefully. Unless she had looked
very closely she would not have seen that it
was broken.</p>

<p>Suddenly she felt a Presence in the room,
and looked up quickly, with terror clutching
at her inmost soul. A tall, grey figure, mysteriously
shrouded, stood motionless beside her.
Only the eyes were unveiled and visible amid
the misty folds of the fabric.</p>

<p>The eyes held her strangely. They were
deep and dark and burning with secret fires.
Hunger and longing were in their depths, and
yet there was a certain exaltation, as of hope
persisting against the knowledge of defeat.</p>

<p>Rosemary's terror gradually vanished. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
felt an all-pervading calmness, a sense of
acceptance, of fulfilment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Not of
One's Own
Choice</div>

<p>For a long time she stood there, transfixed
by the eyes that never for an instant wavered
from hers. They searched her inmost soul;
they saw all things past and to come. They
questioned her, challenged her, urged something
upon her, and yet she was not afraid.</p>

<p>At last, with dry lips, she spoke. "Who
are you?" She did not recognise the sound
of her own voice.</p>

<p>"The Lord of Life," the figure answered, in
low, deep tones that vibrated through the
empty rooms like the swept strings of a harp.</p>

<p>"And this is&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"The House of the Broken Heart. I live
here."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not of my own choice. Why have you
come?"</p>

<p>"Not of my own choice," she repeated,
dully. "I came because I had to."</p>

<p>"They all do. That is why I myself am
here."</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;do many come?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Rosemary looked back over her shoulder,
then lifted her eyes to those of the grey
figure. "Then it is strange," she said, "that
I am here alone."</p>

<p>"You are not alone. These rooms are full,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
but no one sees another in the House of the
Broken Heart. Each one is absorbed in his
own grief to the exclusion of all else. Only I
may see them, with bowed heads, pacing to
and fro.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Selfish
Grief</div>

<p>"On the stairway," he went on, "is a
young mother who has lost her child. She
goes up and down endlessly, thinking first
she hears it crying for her in the room above,
and then in the room below. Her husband
sits at the foot of the stairs with his face
hidden in his hands, but she has no thought for
him. He has lost wife and child too."</p>

<p>"Poor man!" said Rosemary, softly. "Poor
woman!"</p>

<p>"Yonder is a grey-haired woman, reaping
the bitterness that she has sown. There are a
husband and wife who have always been jealous
of one another, and will be, until the end of
time. There is a girl who has trusted and been
betrayed, but she will go out again when her
courage comes back. Just behind you is a
woman who has estranged her husband from
his family and has found his heart closed to
her in the hour of her greatest need. Coming
toward you is a man who was cruel to his wife,
and never knew it until after she was dead."</p>

<p>"But," Rosemary asked, "is there no
punishment?"</p>

<p>"None whatever, except this. The consciousness
of a sin is its own punishment."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Some One
Gift</div>

<p>She stood there perplexed, leaning against
the table. "Have all who are here, then,
sinned?"</p>

<p>"No, some have been sinned against, and
a few, like yourself, have come in by mistake."</p>

<p>"Then I may go?"</p>

<p>The Lord of Life bent his head graciously.
"Whenever you choose. You have only to
take your gift and depart."</p>

<p>"Is there a gift here for me? Nobody ever
gave me anything."</p>

<p>"Some one gift is yours for the asking, and,
because you have not sinned, you have the
right to choose. What shall it be?"</p>

<p>"Love," returned Rosemary, very wistfully.
"Oh, give me love!"</p>

<p>The Lord of Life sighed. "So many ask for
that," he said. "They all confuse the end
with the means. What they really want is
joy, but they ask for love."</p>

<p>"Is there a greater joy than love?"</p>

<p>"No, but love in itself is not joy. It is always
service and it may be sacrifice. It means
giving, not receiving; asking, not answer."</p>

<p>"None the less," said Rosemary, stubbornly,
"I will take love."</p>

<p>"They all do," he returned. "Wait."</p>

<p>He vanished so quickly that she could not
tell which way he had gone. As she leaned
against the table, the brown alpaca cover
slipped back on the marble table and the glass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
case tottered. She caught it hurriedly and
saved it from falling, but the waxen pieces of
the heart quivered underneath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Symbol of
Hope</div>

<p>The grey figure was coming back, muffled
to the eyes as before, but his footsteps made
no sound. He moved slowly, yet with a certain
authority. He laid a letter on the table
and Rosemary snatched it up eagerly. It was
addressed to Mrs. Virginia Marsh.</p>

<p>"That is not for me," she said, much disappointed.
"My name is Rosemary Starr."</p>

<p>"It must have something to do with you,"
he returned, unmoved. "However, I will
keep it until the owner comes."</p>

<p>"She doesn't belong here," Rosemary
answered, somewhat resentfully. "She's the
dearest, sweetest woman in the world. She's
Alden's mother."</p>

<p>"The one who wrote it may be here, or
coming," he explained, patiently. "Sometimes
it happens that way. There are many
letters in this place."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he placed a green wreath upon
Rosemary's head and gave her a white lily,
on a long stem. "Go," he said, kindly.</p>

<p>"But my gift?"</p>

<p>"Go and find it. Carry your symbol of
Hope and wear your wreath of rue. You will
come to it."</p>

<p>"But where? How shall I go from here?
I'm afraid I shall lose my way."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">On the
Upward
Trail</div>

<p>The stern eyes fixed themselves upon her
steadily. "Do not question Life too much,"
he warned her. "Accept it. Have I not
told you to go?"</p>

<p>Her fear suddenly returned. She went
backward, slowly, toward the door, away from
the table and the tall grey figure that stood
by it, holding the letter addressed to Mrs.
Virginia Marsh. When she was outside, she
drew a long breath of relief. It was daybreak,
and grey lights on the far horizon foreshadowed
the sunrise.</p>

<p>She ran down the steps, stumbling as she
passed the broken one, and went hurriedly
down the weed-choked path. The broken
marble statues were green with mould and the
falling waters seemed to move with difficulty,
like the breath of one about to die. The stillness
of the place was vast and far-reaching;
it encompassed her as the night had previously
done.</p>

<p>She soon found the trail that led upward,
though she did not recognise the point at
which she had turned into the garden. She
had no doubt, now, about the path she must
take. It led up, up, through thorns and
brambles, past the crags upon which the first
light shone, and around the crest of the peak
to&mdash;what? Drawing a long breath, Rosemary
started, carrying her lily and wearing her
wreath of rue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Coming
Dawn</div>

<p>The brown gingham hung in tatters and her
worn shoes threatened to drop from her feet,
but the divine fragrance of the lily she bore
sustained her as she climbed. She was glad
she had chosen as she had, though his words
still puzzled her. "It is always service," she
repeated, "and it may be sacrifice. It means
giving, not receiving; asking, not answer."</p>

<p>"And yet," she mused, "he said they all
asked for it. I should have taken the letter,"
she continued, to herself. "Alden could have
given it to his mother."</p>

<p>It seemed strange to be thinking of him as
"Alden" instead of "Mr. Marsh," and yet it
was supremely sweet. She felt the colour
burning in her cheeks, for she knew, now,
that he awaited her, somewhere on the height.
Had he not chosen Love too? Were they not
to find it together?</p>

<p>Dull, prismatic fires glowed upon the distant
clouds&mdash;dawn-jewels laid upon the breast of
Night. Violet and blue mellowed into opal
and turquoise, then, as the spectrum may
merge into white light, a shaft of sunrise
broke from the mysterious East, sending a
javelin of glory half-way across the world.</p>

<p>The first light lay upon the crags, then
deepened and spread, penetrating the darkness
below, which was no longer black, but dusky
purple. Rosemary's heart sang as she climbed,
and the fragrance of the lily thrilled her soul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
with pure delight. The path was smooth,
now, and thorns no longer hurt her feet.
The hand that held the lily, however, was
bleeding, from some sharp thorn or projection
of rock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Blood-Stained
Lily</div>

<p>She wiped her hand upon her torn dress,
and, as she did so, a drop of blood stained the
lily. She tried to get it off, but all her efforts
were fruitless. The crimson spread and darkened
until half of the white petals were dyed.
She noted, with a queer lump in her throat,
that the lily was the same colour as the waxen
heart that lay under the glass case in the house
she had so recently left.</p>

<p>But she still held it tightly, though it was
stained and no longer fragrant. Up somewhere
in the sunrise Alden was waiting for her,
and she climbed breathlessly. She was exhausted
when she reached the summit, and
the wreath of rue pressed heavily upon her
temples.</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, realising that
she had reached the end of her journey. Rainbow
mists surrounded the height, but, as she
looked, they lifted. She was not surprised to
see Alden standing there. He had been hidden
by the mists.</p>

<p>With a little laugh of joy, Rosemary tried
to run toward him, but her feet refused to
move. Then she called: "Alden!" and again,
in a troubled tone: "Mr. Marsh!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Calling in
Vain</div>

<p>But only the echo of her own voice came
back to her, for Alden did not move. Strong
and finely-moulded, his youth surrounded him
like some radiant garment of immortality.
Every line of his figure was eloquent of his
lusty manhood, and his face glowed not only
from the sunrise, but from some inner light.</p>

<p>"Service, sacrifice. Giving, not receiving;
asking, not answer." The words reverberated
through her consciousness like a funeral
knell. She dropped the stained lily and called
again, weakly: "Alden!"</p>

<p>But, as before, he did not answer. His
eyes were fixed upon a distant point where
the coloured mists were slowly lifting. Rosemary,
cold and still, could only stand there
and watch, for her feet refused to stir.</p>

<p>Hungrily, she gazed upon him, but he did
not see, for he was watching the drifting rainbow
beyond. Then a cry of rapture broke
from him and he started eagerly toward the
insurmountable crags that divided him from
the Vision.</p>

<p>Rosemary saw it, too, at the same instant&mdash;a
woman whose white gown shimmered and
shone, and whose face was hidden by the
blinding glory of her sunlit hair.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>She woke, murmuring his name, then rubbed
her eyes. It took her several minutes to realise
that it was all a dream. She was in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
own little room in the brown house, and the
sun was peeping through the shutters. The
holes in the rag carpet, the cheap, cracked
mirror, the braided mat in front of her washstand,
and the broken pitcher all contrived to
reassure her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fair
Future</div>

<p>She sat up in bed, knowing that it was time
to get up, but desperately needing a few
moments in which to adjust herself to her
realities. What had happened? Nothing, indeed,
since yesterday&mdash;ah, that dear yesterday,
when life had begun! What could ever happen
now, when all the future lay fair before her
and the miseries of her twenty-five years were
overwhelmed by one deep intoxicating joy?</p>

<p>"Dreams," thought Rosemary, laughing to
herself. "Ah, what are dreams!"</p>

<p>She opened the shutters wide and the daylight
streamed in. It was not fraught with
colour, like the mists of her dream, but was the
clear, sane light of every day. A robin outside
her window chirped cheerily, and a bluebird
flashed across the distant meadow, then
paused on the rushes at the bend of the river
and swayed there for a moment, like some
unfamiliar flower.</p>

<p>"Rosemary!" The shrill voice sounded just
outside her door.</p>

<p>"Yes, Aunt Matilda," she answered, happily;
"I'm coming!"</p>

<p>She sang to herself as she moved about her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
room, loving the dear, common things of every
day&mdash;the splash of cool water on her face and
throat, the patchwork quilt, and even the despised
brown gingham, which was, at least,
fresh and clean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Service
and
Sacrifice</div>

<p>"Service," she said to herself, "and sacrifice.
Giving, not receiving; asking, and not
answer. I wonder if it's true!" For an
instant she was afraid, then her soul rallied as
to a bugle call. "Even so," she thought, "I'll
take it, and gladly. I'll serve and sacrifice
and give, and never mind the answer."</p>

<p>She hurried down-stairs, where the others
were waiting. "You're late, Rosemary,"
said Grandmother, sourly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," laughed the girl, stooping
to kiss the withered cheek. "I'm sorry! I
won't let it happen again!"</p>

<p>Out in the kitchen, she sang as she worked,
and the clatter of pots and pans kept up a
merry accompaniment. She had set the table
the night before, as usual, so it was not long
before she had breakfast ready. Her cheeks
were flushed and her eyes were shining when
she came in with the oatmeal.</p>

<p>"This is for you, Aunt Matilda&mdash;it isn't
cooked quite so much. This is for you, Grandmother.
It's nice and soft, for I soaked it
over night. I'll have the eggs ready in just
a minute."</p>

<p>When she went out, the other two exchanged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
glances. "What," asked Grandmother, "do
you reckon has got into Rosemary?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Has
Happened?</div>

<p>"I don't know," returned Aunt Matilda,
gloomily. "Do you suppose it's religion?"</p>

<p>"I ain't never seen religion affect anybody
like that, have you?'</p>

<p>"No, I ain't," Aunt Matilda admitted, after
a moment's pondering.</p>

<p>"She reminds me of her ma," said Grandmother,
reminiscently, "the day Frank brought
her home."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A New
Point of
View</div>

<p>The new joy surged in every heart-beat
as Rosemary went up the Hill of the
Muses, late in the afternoon. Instinctively,
she sought the place of fulfilment, yearning
to be alone with the memory of yesterday.</p>

<p>Nothing was wrong in all the world; nothing
ever could be wrong any more. She accepted
the brown alpaca and the brown gingham as
she did the sordid tasks of every day. That
morning, for the first time, it had been a
pleasure to wash dishes and happiness to
build a fire.</p>

<p>Grandmother and Aunt Matilda had been
annoyances to her ever since she could remember.
Their continual nagging had fretted her,
their constant restraint had chafed her, their
narrowness had cramped her. To-day she
saw them from a new point of view.</p>

<p>Grandmother was no longer a malicious
spirit of evil who took delight in thwarting
her, but a poor, fretful old lady whose soul
was bound in shallows. And Aunt Matilda?
Rosemary's eyes filled at the thought of Aunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Matilda, unloved and unsought. Nobody
wanted her, she belonged to nobody, in all her
lonely life she had had nothing. She sat and
listened to Grandmother, she did the annual
sewing, and day by day resented more keenly
the emptiness of her life. It was the conscious
lack that made them both cross. Rosemary
saw it now, with the clear vision that had
come to her during the past twenty-four
hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Joy of
Living</div>

<p>She wanted to be very kind to Grandmother
and Aunt Matilda. It was not a philanthropic
resolution, but a spontaneous desire to share
her own gladness, and to lead the others, if
she might, from the chill darkness in which
they dwelt to the clear air of the heights.</p>

<p>Oh, but it was good to be alive! The little
birds that hopped from bough to bough
chirped ecstatically, the nine silver-clad birches
swayed and nodded in the cool wind, and the
peaceful river in the valley below sparkled and
dimpled at the caress of the sun. The thousand
sounds and fragrances of Spring thrilled
her to eager answer; she, too, aspired and
yearned upward as the wakened grass-blades
pierced the sod and the violets of last year
dreamed once more of bloom.</p>

<p>Yesterday she had emerged from darkness
into light. She had been born again as surely
as the tiny dweller of the sea casts off his shell.
The outworn habitation of the past was for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>ever
left behind her, to be swept back, by the
tides of the new life, into some forgotten cave.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Build thee more stately mansions, oh my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As the swift seasons roll."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">The
Same, Yet
Different</div>

<p>The words said themselves aloud. She had
learned the whole poem long ago, but, to-day,
the beautiful lines assumed a fresh significance,
for had she not, by a single step, passed from
the cell of self into comradeship with the whole
world? Was she not a part of everything
and had not everything become a part of
her? What could go wrong when the finite
was once merged with the infinite, the individual
with the universal soul?</p>

<p>She sat down on the log that Alden had
rolled back against the two trees, three years
ago, when they had first begun to come to the
Hill of the Muses for an occasional hour of
friendly talk. Everything was the same, and
yet subtly different, as though seen from
another aspect or in another light. Over
yonder, on the hillside farthest from the valley,
he had put his arm around her and refused to
let her go.</p>

<p>She remembered vividly every word and
every look and that first shy kiss. Of course
they belonged together! How foolish they
had been not to see it before! Was she not
the only woman he knew, and was he not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
only man to whom she could say more than
"How do you do?" God had meant it so
from the beginning, ever since He said: "Let
there be light, and there was light."</p>

<div class="sidenote">An
Unwonted
Shyness</div>

<p>Dreaming happily, Rosemary sat on the
fallen tree, leaning against the great oak that
towered above her. The first pink leaves had
come out upon the brown branches, and
through them she could see the blue sky, deep
as turquoise, without a single cloud. It
seemed that she had always been happy, but
had never known it until this new light shone
upon her, flooding with divine radiance every
darkened recess of her soul.</p>

<p>She went to the hollow tree, took out the
wooden box, and unwound the scarlet ribbon.
Yesterday, little dreaming of the portent that
for once accompanied the signal, she had tied
it in its accustomed place, and gone back,
calmly to wait. The school bell echoed through
the valley as she stood there, her eyes laughing,
but her mouth very grave. She had
taken two or three steps toward the birches
when an unwonted shyness possessed her, and
she hurried back.</p>

<p>"I can't," she said to herself. "Oh, I
can't&mdash;to-day!"</p>

<p>So she restored it to its place, wondering,
as she did so, why love should make such
mysterious changes in the common things of
every day. Won and awakened though she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
was, her womanhood imperatively demanded
now that she must be sought and never seek,
that she must not even beckon him to her, and
that she must wait, according to her destiny,
as women have waited since the world began.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Waiting</div>

<p>Yet it was part of the beautiful magic of the
day that presently he should come to her,
unsummoned save by her longing and his
own desire.</p>

<p>"Where is the ribbon?" he inquired, reproachfully,
when he came within speaking
distance.</p>

<p>"Where it belongs," she answered, with a
flush.</p>

<p>"Didn't you want me to come?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you hang it up?"</p>

<p>"Just because I wanted you to come."</p>

<p>Alden laughed at her feminine inconsistency,
as he took her face between his hands and
kissed her, half-shyly still. "Did you sleep
last night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I had a horrible dream. I was
glad to wake up this morning."</p>

<p>"I didn't sleep, so all my dreams were
wakeful ones. You're not sorry, are you,
Rosemary?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed! How could I ever be sorry?"</p>

<p>"You never shall be, if I can help it. I
want to be good to you, dear. If I'm ever
otherwise, you'll tell me so, won't you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Always</div>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;I won't promise."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because, even if you weren't good to me,
I'd know you never meant it." Rosemary's
eyes were grave and sweet; eloquent, as they
were, of her perfect trust in him.</p>

<p>He laughed again. "I'd be a brute not
to be good to you, whether I meant it or
not."</p>

<p>"That sounds twisted," she commented,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"But it isn't, as long as you know what I
mean."</p>

<p>"I'll always know," sighed Rosemary,
blissfully leaning her head against his shoulder.
"I'll always understand and I'll never fail
you. That's because I love you better than
everything else in the world."</p>

<p>"Dear little saint," he murmured; "you're
too good for me."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not. On the contrary, I'm not
half good enough." Then, after a pause, she
asked the old, old question, first always from
the lips of the woman beloved: "When did
you begin to&mdash;care?"</p>

<p>"I must have cared when we first began to
come here, only I was so blind I didn't know
it."</p>

<p>"When did you&mdash;know?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday. I didn't keep it to myself
very long."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">When
Shall It
Be?</div>

<p>"Dear yesterday!" she breathed, half regretfully.</p>

<p>"Do you want it back?"</p>

<p>She turned reproachful eyes upon him.
"Why should I want yesterday when I have
to-day?"</p>

<p>"And to-morrow," he supplemented, "and
all the to-morrows to come."</p>

<p>"Together," she said, with a swift realisation
of the sweetness underlying the word. "Yesterday
was perfect, like a jewel that we can
put away and keep. When we want to, we can
always go back and look at it."</p>

<p>"No, dear," he returned, soberly; "no one
can ever go back to yesterday." Then, with
a swift change of mood, he asked: "When shall
we be married?"</p>

<p>"Whenever you like," she whispered, her
eyes downcast and her colour receding.</p>

<p>"In the Fall, then, when the grapes have
been gathered and just before school begins?"</p>

<p>He could scarcely hear her murmured:
"Yes."</p>

<p>"I want to take you to town and let you
see things. Theatres, concerts, operas, parks,
shops, art galleries, everything. If the crop is
in early, we should be able to have two weeks.
Do you think you could crowd all the lost
opportunities of a lifetime into two weeks?"</p>

<p>"Into a day, with you."</p>

<p>He drew her closer. This sort of thing was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
very sweet to him, and the girl's dull personality
had bloomed like some pale, delicate
flower. He saw unfathomed depths in her
grey eyes, shining now, with the indescribable
light that comes from within. She had been
negative and colourless, but now she was a
lovely mystery&mdash;a half-blown windflower on
some brown, bare hillside, where Life, in all its
fulness, was yet to come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What
Will
They Say?</div>

<p>"Did you tell your Grandmother and Aunt
Matilda?"</p>

<p>"No. How could I?"</p>

<p>"You'd better not. They'd only make it
hard for you, and I wouldn't be allowed in the
parlour anyway."</p>

<p>Rosemary had not thought of that. It was
only that her beautiful secret was too sacred
to put into words. "They'll have to know
some time," she temporised.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, but not until the last minute.
The day we're to be married, you can just
put on your hat and say: 'Grandmother, and
Aunty, I'm going out now, to be married to
Alden Marsh. I shan't be back, so good-bye."</p>

<p>She laughed, but none the less the idea filled
her with consternation. "What will they
say!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter what they say, as long
as you're not there to hear it."</p>

<p>"Clothes," she said, half to herself. "I
can't be married in brown alpaca, can I?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Difference</div>

<p>"I don't know why not. We'll take the
fatal step as early as possible in the morning,
catch the first train to town, you can shop all
the afternoon to your heart's content, and be
dressed like a fine lady in time for dinner in the
evening."</p>

<p>"Grandmother was married in brown alpaca,"
she continued, irrelevantly, "and
Aunt Matilda wore it the night the minister
came to call."</p>

<p>"Did he never come again?"</p>

<p>"No. Do you think it could have been the
alpaca?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure it wasn't. Aunt Matilda was
foreordained to be an old maid."</p>

<p>"She won't allow anyone to speak of her
as an old maid. She says she's a spinster."</p>

<p>"What's the difference?"</p>

<p>"I think," returned Rosemary, pensively,
"that an old maid is a woman who never could
have married and a spinster is merely one who
hasn't."</p>

<p>"Is it a question of opportunity?"</p>

<p>"I believe so."</p>

<p>"Then you're wrong, because some of the
worst old maids I've ever known have been
married women. I've seen men, too, who
deserve the title."</p>

<p>"Poor Aunt Matilda," Rosemary sighed;
"I'm sorry for her."</p>

<p>"Why?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Alden's
Mother</div>

<p>"Because she hasn't anyone to love her&mdash;because
she hasn't you. I'm sorry for every
other woman in the world," she concluded,
generously, "because I have you all to
myself."</p>

<p>"Sweet," he answered, possessing himself
of her hand, "don't forget that you must
divide me with mother."</p>

<p>"I won't. Will she care, do you think,
because&mdash;" Her voice trailed off into an indistinct
murmur.</p>

<p>"Of course not. She's glad. I told her
this morning."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Rosemary, suddenly tremulous
and afraid. "What did she say?"</p>

<p>"She was surprised at first." Alden carefully
refrained from saying how much his
mother had been surprised and how long it had
been before she found herself equal to the
occasion.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and then?"</p>

<p>"Then she said she was glad; that she
wanted me to be happy. She told me that
she had always liked you and that the house
wouldn't be so lonely after you came to live
with us. Then she asked me to bring you to see
her, as soon as you were ready to come."</p>

<p>The full tide overflowed in the girl's heart.
She yearned toward Mrs. Marsh with worship,
adoration, love. The mother-hunger made her
faint with longing for a woman's arms around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
her, for a woman's tears of joy to mingle with
her own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Madame's
Welcome</div>

<p>"Take me to her," Rosemary pleaded.
"Take me now!"</p>

<p>Madame saw them coming and went to the
door to meet them. Rosemary was not at all
what she had fancied in the way of a daughter-in-law,
but, wisely, she determined to make
the best of Alden's choice. Something in her
stirred in answer to the infinite appeal in the
girl's eyes. At the crowning moment of her
life, Rosemary stood alone, fatherless, motherless,
friendless, with only brown alpaca to take
the place of all the pretty things that seem
girlhood's right.</p>

<p>Madame smiled, then opened her arms.
Without a word, Rosemary went to her, laid
her head upon the sweet, silken softness of the
old lady's shoulder, and began to cry softly.</p>

<p>"Daughter," whispered Madame, holding
her close. "My dear daughter! Please
don't!"</p>

<p>Rosemary laughed through her tears, then
wiped her eyes. "It's only an April rain,"
she said. "I'm crying because I'm so
happy."</p>

<p>"I wish," responded Madame, gently, with
a glance at her son, "that I might be sure all
the tears either of you are ever to shed would
be tears of joy. It's the bitterness that
hurts."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Tears</div>

<p>"Don't be pessimistic, Mother," said Alden,
with a little break in his voice. Rosemary's
tears woke all his tenderness. He longed to
shield and shelter her; to stand, if he might,
between her and the thousand pricks and
stabs of the world.</p>

<p>"We'll have tea," Madame went on,
brightly, ringing a silver bell as she spoke.
"Then we shan't be quite so serious."</p>

<p>"Woman's inevitable solace," Alden observed,
lounging about the room with his hands
in his pockets. Man-like, he welcomed the
change of mood.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he continued, with forced
cheerfulness, "why people always cry at
weddings and engagements and such things?
A husband or wife is the only relative we are
permitted to choose&mdash;we even have very little
to say when it comes to a mother-in-law.
With parents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts,
and cousins all provided by a generous but
sometimes indiscriminating Fate, it seems
hard that one's only choice should be made
unpleasant by salt water.</p>

<p>"Why," he went on, warming to his subject,
"I remember how a certain woman
angled industriously for months to capture an
unsuspecting young man for her daughter.
When she finally landed him, and the ceremony
came off to the usual accompaniment
of Mendelssohn and a crowded church, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
feared that the bridal couple might have to
come down the aisle from the altar in a canoe,
on account of the maternal tears."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A
Contrast</div>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested Rosemary, timidly,
"she was only crying because she was happy."</p>

<p>"If she was as happy as all those tears
would indicate, it's a blessed wonder she
didn't burst."</p>

<p>Madame smiled fondly at her son as she
busied herself with the tea things. Rosemary
watched the white, plump hands that moved
so gracefully among the cups, and her heart
contracted with a swift little pang of envy, of
which she was immediately ashamed. Unconsciously,
she glanced at her own rough, red
hands. Madame saw the look, and understood.</p>

<p>"We'll soon fix them, my dear," she said,
kindly. "I'll show you how to take care of
them."</p>

<p>"Really?" cried Rosemary, gratefully.
"Oh, thank you! Do you suppose that&mdash;that
they'll ever look like yours?"</p>

<p>"Wait and see," Madame temporised. She
was fond of saying that it took three generations
of breeding to produce the hand of a
lady.</p>

<p>The kettle began to sing and the cover
danced cheerily. Tiny clouds of steam trailed
off into space, disappearing in the late afternoon
sunshine like a wraith at dawn. Madame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
filled the blue china tea-pot and the subtle
fragrance permeated the room.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Cup of
Tea</div>

<p>"Think," she said, as she waited the allotted
five minutes for it to steep, "of all I give you
in a cup of tea. See the spicy, sunlit fields,
where men, women, and children, in little
jackets of faded blue, pick it while their
queues bob back and forth. Think of all the
chatter that goes in with the picking&mdash;marriage
and birth and death and talk of houses and
worldly possessions, and everything else that
we speak of here.</p>

<p>"Then the long, sweet drying, and the packing
in dim storehouses, and then the long
journey. Sand and heat and purple dusk,
tinkle of bells and scent of myrrh, the rustle of
silks and the gleam of gold. Then the
open sea, with infinite spaces of shining
blue, and a wake of pearl and silver following
the ship. Dreams and moonbeams and
starry twilights, from the other side of the
world&mdash;here, my dear, I give them all to
you."</p>

<p>She offered Rosemary the cup as she concluded
and the girl smiled back at her happily.
This was all so different from the battered
metal tea-pot that always stood on the back
of the stove at Grandmother's, to be boiled
and re-boiled until the colour was gone from
the leaves. Alden was looking into his cup
with assumed anxiety.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">In the
Bottom of
the Cup</div>

<p>"What's the matter, dear?" asked his
mother. "Isn't it right?"</p>

<p>"I was looking for the poem," he laughed,
"and I see nothing but a stranger."</p>

<p>"Coming?" she asked, idly.</p>

<p>"Of course. See?"</p>

<p>"You're right&mdash;a stranger and trouble.
What is there in your cup, Rosemary?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," she answered, with a
smile, "but a little bit of sugar&mdash;just a few
grains."</p>

<p>Alden came and looked over her shoulder.
Then, with his arm over the back of her chair,
he pressed his cheek to hers. "I hope, my
dear, that whenever you come to the dregs,
you'll always have that much sweetness left."</p>

<p>Rosemary, flushed and embarrassed, made
her adieus awkwardly. "Come again very
soon, dear, won't you?" asked Madame.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, if I may, and thank you so
much. Good-bye, Mrs. Marsh."</p>

<p>"'Mrs. Marsh?'" repeated the old lady,
reproachfully. Some memory of her lost Virginia
made her very tender toward the motherless
girl.</p>

<p>"May I?" Rosemary faltered. "Do you
mean it?"</p>

<p>Madame smiled and lifted her beautiful
old face. Rosemary stooped and kissed her.
"Mother," she said, for the first time in her
life. "Dear Mother! Good-bye!"</p>

<h2 class="gap3 chaphead"><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<h2 class="chaphead">A Letter and a Guest</h2>


<div class="sidenote">An Unexpected
Missive</div>

<p>"A letter for you, Mother," Alden tossed
a violet-scented envelope into the old
lady's lap as he spoke, and stood there, waiting.</p>

<p>"For me!" she exclaimed. Letters for
either of them were infrequent. She took it
up curiously, scrutinised the address, sniffed
at the fragrance the missive carried, noted
the postmark, which was that of the town
near by, and studied the waxen purple seal,
stamped with indistinguishable initials.</p>

<p>"I haven't the faintest idea whom it's
from," she said, helplessly.</p>

<p>"Why not open it and see?" he suggested,
with kindly sarcasm. His assumed carelessness
scarcely veiled his own interest in it.</p>

<p>"You always were a bright boy, Alden,"
she laughed. Another woman might have
torn it open rudely, but Madame searched
through her old mahogany desk until she
found a tarnished silver letter-opener, thus
according due courtesy to her unknown
correspondent.</p>

<p>Having opened it, she discovered that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
could not read the handwriting, which was
angular and involved beyond the power of
words to indicate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A
Woman's
Writing</div>

<p>"Here," she said. "Your eyes are better
than mine."</p>

<p>Alden took it readily. "My eyes may be
good," he observed, after a long pause, "but
my detective powers are not. The <i>m's</i> and <i>n's</i>
are all alike, and so are most of the other letters.
She's an economical person&mdash;she makes the
same hieroglyphic do duty for both a <i>g</i> and
a <i>y</i>."</p>

<p>"It's from a woman, then?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Did you ever know a man to
sprawl a note all over two sheets of paper,
with nothing to distinguish the end from the
beginning? In the nature of things, you'd
expect her to commence at the top of a sheet,
and, in a careless moment, she may have done
so. Let me see&mdash;yes, here it is: 'My dear
Mrs. Marsh.'"</p>

<p>"Go on, please," begged Madame, after a
silence. "It was just beginning to be interesting."</p>

<p>"'During my mother's last illness,'" Alden
read, with difficulty, "'she told me that if I
were ever in trouble, I should go to you&mdash;that
you would stand in her place to me. I write
to ask if I may come, for I can no longer see
the path ahead of me, and much less do I know
the way in which I should go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Schoolmate's
Daughter</div>

<p>"'You surely remember her. She was
Louise Lane before her marriage to my father,
Edward Archer.</p>

<p>"'Please send me a line or two, telling me
I may come, if only for a day. Believe me,
no woman ever needed a friendly hand to
guide her more than</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">"'Yours unhappily,</p>
<p style="margin-left:50%;">"'<span class="smcap">Edith Archer Lee.</span>'"</p>

<p>"Louise Lane," murmured Madame, reminiscently.
"My old schoolmate! I didn't even
know that she had a daughter, or that she was
dead. How strangely we lose track of one
another in this world!"</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Alden, encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Louise was a beautiful girl," continued
Madame, half to herself. "She had big brown
eyes, with long lashes, a thick, creamy skin
that someway reminded you of white rose-petals,
and the most glorious red hair you ever
saw. She married an actor, and I heard
indirectly that she had gone on the stage, then
I lost her entirely."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Alden, again.</p>

<p>"Edith Archer Lee," Madame went on.
"She must be married. Think of Louise Lane
having a daughter old enough to be married!
And yet&mdash;my Virginia would have been
thirty-two now. Dear me, how the time
goes by!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">In
Trouble</div>

<p>The tall clock on the landing chimed five
deep musical strokes, the canary hopped restlessly
about his gilt cage, and the last light of
the sweet Spring afternoon, searching the soft
shadows of the room, found the crystal ball
on the table and made merry with it.</p>

<p>"Time is still going by," Alden reminded
her. "What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>Madame started from her reverie. "Do?
Why, she must come, of course!"</p>

<p>"I don't see why," Alden objected, gloomily.
"I don't like strange women."</p>

<p>"It is not a question of what we like or don't
like, my son," she returned, in gentle reproof.
"She is in trouble and she needs something we
can give her."</p>

<p>"When people are in trouble, they usually
want either money or sympathy, or both."</p>

<p>"Sometimes they only need advice."</p>

<p>"There are lots of places where they can get
it. Advice is as free as salvation is said to be."</p>

<p>Madame sighed. Then she crossed the
room, and put her hands upon his shoulders.
"Dear, are you going to be cross?"</p>

<p>His face softened. "Never to you, if I
know it, but why should strange women invade
the peace of a man's home? Why should a
woman who writes like that come here?"</p>

<p>"Don't blame her for her handwriting&mdash;she
can't help it."</p>

<p>"I don't blame her; far from it. On the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
contrary, I take off my hat to her. A woman
who can take a plain pen, and plain ink, and
do such dazzling wonders on plain paper, is
entitled to sincere respect, if not admiration."</p>

<div class="sidenote">An
Invitation</div>

<p>Smiling, Madame went to her desk, and in
a quaint, old-fashioned script, wrote a note to
Mrs. Lee. "There," she said, as she sealed it.
"I've asked her to come to-morrow on the six
o'clock train. I've told her that you will meet
her at the station, and that we won't have
dinner until half-past seven. That will give
her time to rest and dress. If you'll take it
to the post-office now, she'll get it in the
morning."</p>

<p>Alden shrugged his shoulders good-humouredly,
kissed his mother, and went out. He
wondered how he would recognise the "strange
woman" when she arrived on the morrow,
though few people came on the six o'clock
train, or, for that matter, on any train.</p>

<p>"Might write her a little note on my own
account," he mused. "Ask her to take off
her right shoe and hold it in her left hand, or
something of that sort. No, that isn't necessary.
I'll bet I could go into a crowd of a
thousand women and pick out the one who
wrote that letter."</p>

<p>The scent of violet still haunted him, but,
by the time he had posted his mother's note,
he had forgotten all about it and was thinking
of Rosemary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Planning
for the
Guest</div>

<p>Madame, however, was busy with plans for
her guest's comfort. She took down her best
hand-embroidered linen sheets, shaking out
the lavender that was laid between the folds,
selected her finest towels and dresser-covers,
ransacked three or four trunks in the attic for
an old picture of Louise Lane, found a frame
to fit it, laid out fresh curtains, had the
shining silver candlesticks cleaned again,
and opened wide every window of the long-unused
guest-room to give it a night's
airing.</p>

<p>Downstairs, she searched through the preserve-closet
for dainties to tempt an unhappy
woman's appetite, meanwhile rejoicing with
housewifely pride in her well-stocked shelves.
That evening, while Alden read the paper, she
planned a feast for the next night, and mended,
with fairy-like stitches, the fichu of real lace
that she usually wore with her lavender silk
gown.</p>

<p>"Is it a party?" queried Alden, without
looking up from his paper.</p>

<p>"Yes. Isn't company a party?"</p>

<p>"That depends. You know three are said
to be a crowd."</p>

<p>"Still inhospitable, dear?"</p>

<p>"Only mildly so. I contemplate the approaching
evil with resignation, if not content."</p>

<p>"You and I have lived alone so long that
we've got ourselves into a rut. Everyone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
we meet may give us something, and receive
something from us in return."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Best
Things for
Strangers</div>

<p>"I perceive," said Alden, irrelevantly, "that
the Lady Mother is going to be dressed in her
best when the guest arrives."</p>

<p>A pale pink flush mantled the old lady's fair
cheeks. At the moment she looked like a
faded rose that had somehow preserved its
sweetness.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why do we always do for strangers what
we do not willingly do for our own flesh and
blood?" he queried, philosophically. "You
love me better than anything else in the world,
yet you wouldn't put on that lavender gown
twice a year, just for me alone. The strange
woman may feast her eyes upon it the moment
she enters the house. She'll eat from the best
china, sleep between embroidered sheets, and,
I have no doubt, drink the wine that Father
put away the day I was born, to be opened at
my wedding."</p>

<p>"Not at your wedding, my son, but the day
you found the woman you loved." Then,
after a long pause, she added, shyly:
"Shouldn't it be opened now?"</p>

<p>"It'll keep," the young man grunted.
"After lying for thirty years among the cobwebs,
a few more weeks or months or years, as
the case may be, won't hurt it. Besides, I
don't expect to have any wedding. I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
merely going to be married. Might as well let
the strange woman have it."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Old Wine</div>

<p>Alden's father had, as he said, put away on
the day he was born all the wine that was then
ready to be bottled. The baby girl had been
welcomed gladly, especially as she had her
mother's eyes, but the day the second Alden
Marsh was born, the young father's joy had
known no bounds. He had gone, at dusk, to
the pale little mother, and, holding her in his
arms, had told her about the wine.</p>

<p>"I've put it all away," he had said, "for
the boy. He's to open it the day he finds the
woman he loves as I love you."</p>

<p>The shelf in the storeroom, where he had
placed it, had never been disturbed, though
dust and cobwebs lay thickly upon it and
Madame had always prided herself upon her
immaculate housekeeping. It grieved her
inexpressibly because Alden cared so little
about it, and had for it, apparently, no sentiment
at all. To her it was sacred, like some
rare wine laid aside for communion, but, as she
reflected, the boy's father had died before he
was much more than a child.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember your father at all?"
asked Madame, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"I can't say that I do&mdash;that is, not before
he died." The casket and the gloom of mourning
had made its own vivid impression upon
the child's sensitive mind. One moment stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
out quite clearly, but he forebore to say so.
It was when his mother, with the tears raining
down her face, had lifted him in her arms and
bade him look at the man who lay in the casket,
oh, so cold and still.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Passing of
the Father</div>

<p>"Say good-bye to Father, dear," she had
sobbed. "Is Father gone away?" he had
asked, in childish terror, then she had strained
him to her heart, crying out: "Just for a little
while! Oh, if I could only believe it was for
just a little while!"</p>

<p>The rest had faded into a mist of sadness
that, for a long time, had not even begun to
lift. When he found his mother in tears, as
he often did after that, he went away quietly,
knowing that she longed for "Father," who
had gone away and never returned. Later,
he used to sit on the top step of the big Colonial
porch&mdash;a fragile little figure&mdash;waiting, through
the long Summer afternoons, for the father
who did not come.</p>

<p>Once, when his mother was so absorbed in
her grief that she did not hear him come into
the room, he had laid a timid, trembling hand
upon her knee, saying: "Mother, if you will
tell me where Father is, I will go and bring him
back." But, instead of accepting the offer,
she had caught him to her breast, sobbing, with
a sudden rush of impassioned prayer: "Dear
God, no&mdash;not that!"</p>

<p>Time, as always, had done his merciful heal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>ing,
which, though slow, is divinely sure.
Madame was smiling, now, at some old memory
that had come mysteriously out of the shadow,
leaving all bitterness behind. She had finished
mending the lace and had laid it aside.
Alden took it up, awkwardly, and looked at it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tired and
Unhappy</div>

<p>"This for the strange woman," he said,
teasingly, "and plain black or grey silk for me,
though I am fain to believe that you love me
best. Why is it?"</p>

<p>"Because," she responded, playfully, "you
know me and love me, even without fuss and
frills. For those who do not know us, we
must put our best foot forward, in order to
make sure of the attention our real merit
deserves."</p>

<p>"But doesn't immediately command&mdash;is
that it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"What must I wear to the train&mdash;my dress
suit?"</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish, son. You'll have plenty
of time to dress after you get home."</p>

<p>"Shall I drive, or walk?"</p>

<p>"Take the carriage. She'll be tired. Unhappy
women are always tired."</p>

<p>"Are they tired because they're unhappy,
or unhappy because they're tired? And do
they get unhappier when they get more tired,
or do they get more tired when they get
unhappier?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Arrival</div>

<p>"Don't ask me any more conundrums to-night.
I'm going to bed, to get my beauty
sleep."</p>

<p>"You must have had a great many, judging
by the results."</p>

<p>Madame smiled as she bent to kiss his rough
cheek. "Good-night, my dear. Think of some
other pleasant things and say them to-morrow
night to Mrs. Lee."</p>

<p>"I'll be blest if I will," Alden muttered to
himself, as his mother lighted a candle and
waved her hand prettily in farewell. "If all
the distressed daughters of all mother's old
schoolmates are coming here, to cry on her
shoulder and flood the whole place with salt
water, it's time for me to put up a little tent
somewhere and move into it."</p>

<p>By the next day, however, he had forgotten
his ill-humour and was at the station fully ten
minutes before six o'clock. As it happened,
only one woman was among the passengers who
left the train at that point.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lee?" he asked, taking her suit-case
from her.</p>

<p>"Yes. Mr. Marsh?"</p>

<p>"Yes. This way, please."</p>

<p>"How did you know me?" she inquired, as she
took her place in the worn coup&eacute; that had been
in the Marsh stables for almost twenty years.</p>

<p>"By your handwriting," he laughed, closing
the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">With Bag
and
Baggage</div>

<p>A smile hovered for a moment around the
corners of her mouth, then disappeared.</p>

<p>"Then, too," he went on, "as you were the
only woman who got off the train, and we
were expecting you, I took the liberty of speaking
to you."</p>

<p>"Did you ask the man to have my trunk
sent up?"</p>

<p>"Trunk!" echoed Alden, helplessly. "Why,
no! Was there a trunk?"</p>

<p>She laughed&mdash;a little, low rippling laugh
that had in it an undertone of sadness. There
was a peculiar, throaty quality in her voice,
like a muted violin or 'cello. "Don't be so
frightened, please, for I'm not going to stay
long, really. I'm merely the sort of woman
who can't stay over night anywhere without a
lot of baggage."</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it wasn't that," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was. You don't need to tell me
polite fibs, you know. How far are we from
the house?"</p>

<p>"Not as far," returned Alden, rallying all
his forces for one supreme effort of gallantry,
"as I wish we were."</p>

<p>She laughed again, began to speak, then
relapsed into silence. Furtively, in the gathering
shadow, he studied her face. She was
pale and cold, the delicate lines of her profile
conveyed a certain aloofness of spirit, and her
mouth drooped at the corners. Her hat and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
veil covered her hair, but she had brown eyes
with long lashes. Very long lashes, Alden
noted, having looked at them a second time to
make sure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Child of
the City</div>

<p>The silence became awkward, but he could
think of nothing to say. She had turned her
face away from him and was looking out of the
window. "How lovely the country is," she
said, pensively. "I wish sometimes I never
had to step on a pavement again."</p>

<p>"Do you have to?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, for I'm over-civilised. Like the god
in Greek mythology, I need the touch of earth
occasionally to renew my strength, but a very
brief contact is all-sufficient. I'm a child of
the city, brought up on smoke and noise."</p>

<p>"You don't look it," he said, chiefly because
he could think of nothing else to say.</p>

<p>Madame herself opened the door for them,
with the old-fashioned hospitality which has
an indefinable charm of its own. "How do
you do, my dear," she said, taking the hand the
younger woman offered her. In the instant of
feminine appraisement, she had noted the
perfectly tailored black gown, the immaculate
shirtwaist and linen collar, and the discerning
taste that forbade plumes. The fresh, cool
odour of violets persisted all the way up-stairs,
as Madame chattered along sociably, eager to
put the guest at her ease.</p>

<p>Below, they heard Alden giving orders about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the trunk, and Mrs. Lee smiled&mdash;a little, wan
ghost of a smile that Madame misunderstood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Resting</div>

<p>"You don't need to dress, if you're tired,"
she suggested, kindly, "though we always do.
Come down just as you are."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee turned to the dainty little woman
who stood before her, arrayed in shining
lavender silk. The real-lace fichu was fastened
at the waist with an amethyst pin and at her
throat she wore a string of silver beads. Her
white hair was beautifully dressed, and somewhere,
among the smooth coils and fluffy softness,
one caught the gleam of a filigree silver
comb.</p>

<p>"Not dress?" she said. "Indeed I shall, as
soon as my trunk comes. That is," she added,
hastily, "if there's anyone to hook me up."</p>

<p>"There is," Madame assured her. "I'll
leave you now to rest. We dine at half-past
seven."</p>

<p>The sweetness of the lavender-scented room
brought balm to Edith Lee's tired soul.
"How lovely she is," she said to herself, as she
noted the many thoughtful provisions for her
comfort, "and how good it is to be here."</p>

<p>A silver-framed photograph stood on her
dressing-table, and she picked it up, wondering
who it might be. The hair and gown were
old-fashioned, and the face seemed old-fashioned
also, but, in a moment, she had
recognised her mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Newcomer
in
Green</div>

<p>Tenderness for the dead and the living filled
her heart. How dear it was of Madame to
have placed it there&mdash;this little young mother,
just budding into womanhood! It had been
taken long before she had known of Edith, or
had more than dreamed of love.</p>

<p>The arrival of the trunk compelled her to
brush away a few foolish tears. She did not
stop to unpack, but only took out the dinner
gown that lay on top.</p>

<p>Promptly at half-past seven, she went
down into the living-room, where Alden and
his mother were waiting to receive her. Madame
smiled with pure delight at the vision that
greeted her, but the young man forgot his
manners and stared&mdash;stared like the veriest
schoolboy at the tall, stately figure, clad in
shimmering pale green satin that rippled about
her feet as she walked, brought out a bit of
colour in her cheeks and lips, deepened the
brown of her eyes, and, like the stalk and
leaves of a tiger-lily, faded into utter insignificance
before the burnished masses of her
red-gold hair.</p>

<h2 class="chaphead">"Whom God Hath Joined"</h2>


<div class="sidenote">A
Fortunate
Woman</div>

<p>Breakfast had been cleared away and
Alden, with evident regret, had gone to
school. Madame gave her orders for the day,
attended to a bit of dusting which she would
trust no one else to do, gathered up the weekly
mending and came into the living-room, where
the guest sat, idly, robed in a gorgeous neglig&eacute;e
of sea-green cr&ecirc;pe which was fully as becoming
as her dinner-gown had been the night before.</p>

<p>Madame had observed that Mrs. Lee was one
of the rarely fortunate women who look as well
in the morning as in the evening. Last night,
in the glow of the pink-shaded candles, she
had been beautiful, and this morning she was
no less lovely, though she sat in direct sunlight
that made a halo of her hair.</p>

<p>The thick, creamy skin, a direct legacy from
Louise Lane, needed neither powder nor rouge,
and the scarlet lips asked for no touch of carmine.
But the big brown eyes were wistful
beyond words, the dark hollows beneath spoke
of sleepless nights, and the corners of the sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
mouth drooped continually, in spite of valiant
efforts to smile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why She
Came</div>

<p>"I think I should have known you anywhere,"
Madame began. "You look so much
like your mother."</p>

<p>"Thank you. It was dear of you to put her
picture on my dressing-table. It seemed like
a welcome from her."</p>

<p>Madame asked a few questions about her
old schoolmate, receiving monosyllabic answers,
then waited. The silence was not
awkward, but of that intimate sort which, with
women, precedes confidences.</p>

<p>"I suppose you wonder why I came," the
younger woman said, after a long pause.</p>

<p>"No," Madame replied, gently, "for you
told me in your note that you were troubled
and thought I could help you."</p>

<p>"I don't know why I should have thought of
you especially, though I have never forgotten
what mother told me about coming to you, if
I were in trouble, but two or three days ago,
it came to me all at once that I was wandering
in a maze of darkness and that you could show
me the way out."</p>

<p>"I hope I may," the old lady murmured.
"I shall be very glad to, if I can. What has
gone wrong?"</p>

<p>"Everything," she returned, her brown
eyes filling with mist. "Of course it's my
husband. It always is, isn't it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Running
Away</div>

<p>"I don't know why it should be. Is he
cruel to you?"</p>

<p>"No, that is, he doesn't beat me or anything
of that sort. He isn't coarse. But
there's a refined sort of cruelty that hurts
worse. I&mdash;I couldn't bear it any longer, and
so I came away."</p>

<p>"Was he willing for you to come?"</p>

<p>"I didn't ask him. I just came."</p>

<p>Madame's glasses dropped from her aristocratic
nose in astonishment. "Why, my dear
Mrs. Lee! How could you!"</p>

<p>"Edith, please, if you will," she answered,
wiping her eyes. Then she laughed bitterly.
"Don't be kind to me, for I'm not used to it
and it weakens my armour of self-defence.
Tell me I'm horrid and have done with it."</p>

<p>"Poor child," breathed Madame. "Poor,
dear child!"</p>

<p>For a few moments the young woman bit
her lips, keeping back the tears by evident
effort. Then, having gained her self-control,
she went on.</p>

<p>"I'm twenty-eight, now," she said. "I
remember mother used to say she always had
her suspicions of a woman who was willing to
tell the truth about her age."</p>

<p>"Sounds just like her," commented Madame,
taking up a dainty lavender silk stocking that
had "run down" from the hem.</p>

<p>"I've been married six years, but it seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
like twenty. Almost from the first, there has
been friction between us, but nobody knows it,
except you&mdash;unless he's told his friends, and I
don't think he'd do that. We've both had a
preference for doing the family laundry work
on the premises."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marital
Troubles</div>

<p>"What?" queried Madame, missing the
allusion.</p>

<p>"Not washing our soiled linen in public,"
Edith explained. "While I live with my
husband as his wife, we stand together before
the world as far as it is in my power to manage
it. I do not intentionally criticise him to
anyone, nor permit anyone to criticise him. I
endeavour to look ahead, protect him against
his own weakness or folly, and, as far as a
woman's tact and thought may do, shield him
from the consequences of his own mistakes. I
lie for him whenever necessary or even advisable.
I have tried to be, for six years, shelter,
strength, comfort, courage. And," she concluded
bitterly, "I've failed."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"We live in the same house, but alien and
apart. We talk at the table as two strangers
might in a crowded restaurant or hotel, that is,
when he's there. I dare not ask people to
dinner, for I never know whether he's coming
or not. He might promise faithfully to come,
and then appear at midnight, without apology
or excuse."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">All Sorts
of Subterfuges</div>

<p>"He supports you," suggested Madame,
glancing at the sea-green cr&ecirc;pe.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. That is, the question of
money hasn't arisen between us, one way or
another. I have no children, father and
mother left me plenty of money, and I don't
mind using it in any way that seems advisable.
In fact, if I had to, I'd rather pay the household
bills than beg for money, as many a
wife is compelled to do&mdash;or, for that matter,
even ask for it. It isn't as if I had to earn
it myself, you know. If I had to, I'd probably
feel differently about it, but, as it is, money
doesn't matter between us at all.</p>

<p>"Friends of mine," she resumed, "have to
resort to all sorts of subterfuges. I know
women who bribe the tradespeople to make
their bills larger than they should be and give
them the difference in cash. I know men
who seem to think they do their wives a
favour by paying for the food they themselves
eat, and by paying their own laundry bills.
Then, every once in a while, I see in some
magazine an article written by a man who
wonders why women prefer to work in shops
and factories, rather than to marry. It must
be better to get a pay-envelope every Saturday
night without question or comment, than it is
to humiliate your immortal soul to the dust it
arose from, begging a man for money to pay
for the dinner he ate last night, or for the price<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of a new veil to cover up your last year's
hat."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defiance</div>

<p>"All this," said Madame, threading her
needle again, "is new to me. I live so out of
the world, that I know very little of what is
going on outside."</p>

<p>"Happy woman! Perhaps I should be
happy, also, since this particular phase of the
problem doesn't concern me. Money may not
be your best friend, but it's the quickest to
act, and seems to be favourably recognised in
more places than most friends are. For the
size of it, a check book is about the greatest
convenience I know of."</p>

<p>The brown eyes were cold now, and their
soft lights had become a glitter. The scarlet
mouth was no longer sweet and womanly, but
set into a hard, tight line. Colour burned in
her cheeks&mdash;not a delicate flush, but the
crimson of defiance, of daring. She was, as
she sat there, a living challenge to Fate.</p>

<p>"Is he happy?" queried Madame.</p>

<p>"I suppose so. His ideal of a wife seems to
be one who shall arrange and order his house,
look after his clothing, provide for his material
comfort, be there when he comes, sit at the
head of his table, dressed in her best, when he
deigns to honour dinner with his presence, ask
no questions as to his comings or goings, keep
still if he prefers to read either the morning or
evening paper while he eats, and to refrain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
from annoying him by being ill, or, at least,
by speaking of illness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quiet
Rebuke</div>

<p>"I saw, once, a huge cocoa-husk door-mat,
with the word 'Welcome' on it in big red
letters. I've been sorry ever since that I
didn't buy it, for it typified me so precisely.
It would be nice, wouldn't it, to have at your
front door something that exactly indicated
the person inside, like the overture to a Wagner
opera, using all the themes and <i>motifs</i> that
were coming? That's what I've been for six
years, but, if a worm will turn, why not a
wife?"</p>

<p>"If you'll excuse me for saying so," Madame
answered, in a tone of quiet rebuke, "I don't
think it was quite right to come away without
letting him know you were coming."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"He'll wonder where you are."</p>

<p>"I've had plenty of opportunity to wonder
where he was."</p>

<p>"But what will he think, when he finds out
you have gone?"</p>

<p>"He may not have noticed it. I have competent
servants and they'll look after him as
well or better than I do. If I had left a wax
figure in the library, in one of my gowns, with
its back to the door and its head bent over a
book, I could have been well on my way to
China before I was missed, or, rather, that I
was among those not present. If he has found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
it out, it has been by the application of the same
inductive methods by which I discover that
he's not coming home to dinner."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Do You
Love Him?</div>

<p>"Do you love him?" In the answer to that
question lay Madame's solution of all difficulties,
past and to come. To her, it was the
divine reagent of all Life's complicated chemistry;
the swift turning of the prism, with
ragged edges breaking the light into the colours
of the spectrum, to a point where refraction
was impossible.</p>

<p>"I did," Edith sighed, "but marriage is a
great strain upon love."</p>

<p>The silvery cadence of Madame's laughter
rang through the house and echoed along the
corridor. As though in answer, the clock
struck ten, the canary sang happily, and a
rival melody came from the kitchen, in cracked
soprano, mercifully muted by distance and two
closed doors.</p>

<p>"See what you've started," Edith said.
"It's like the poem, where the magic kiss woke
the princess, and set all the clocks to going
and the little dogs to barking outside. Don't
let me talk you to death&mdash;I've been chattering
for considerably over an hour, and, very selfishly,
of my own affairs, to the exclusion of
everything else."</p>

<p>"But your affairs interest me extremely, I
wish I knew of some way to help you."</p>

<p>"In the last analysis, of course, it comes to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
this&mdash;either go on and make the best of it, or
quit."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Marriage
Vow</div>

<p>"Not&mdash;not divorce," breathed Madame.
Her violet eyes were wide with horror.</p>

<p>"No," Edith answered, shortly, "not
divorce. Separation, possibly, but not divorce,
which is only a legal form permitting one to
marry again. Personally, I feel bound by the
solemn oath I took at the altar, 'until death
do us part,' and 'forsaking all others keep thee
only unto me so long as we both shall live.'
All the laws in the country couldn't make me
feel right with my own conscience if I violated
that oath."</p>

<p>"If the marriage service were changed,"
Madame said, nodding her approval, "it
might be justified. If one said, at the altar,
'Until death or divorce do us part,' or 'Until I
see someone else I like better,' there'd be
reason for it, but, as it is, there isn't. And
again, it says, 'Those whom God hath joined let
no man put asunder.'"</p>

<p>"Those whom God hath joined no man can
put asunder," Edith retorted, "but did God
do it? It doesn't seem right to blame Him
for all the pitiful mistakes that masquerade as
marriage. Mother used to say," she resumed,
after a little, "that when you're more miserable
without a man than you think you ever
could be with him, it's time to marry him, and
when you're more miserable with him than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
you think you ever could be without him, it's
time to quit."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Envious
Women</div>

<p>"And," suggested Madame, "in which class
do you belong?"</p>

<p>"Both, I think&mdash;that is, I'm miserable
enough to belong to both. I'm unhappy
when he's with me and wretched when he
isn't. As he mostly isn't, I'm more wretched
than unhappy. In the small circle in which
I move, I'm considered a very fortunate
woman.</p>

<p>"Women who are compelled to be mendicants
and who do not know that I have a
private income, envy me my gowns and hats,
my ability to ask a friend or two to luncheon
if I choose, and the unfailing comfort of a taxicab
if I'm caught in the rain. They think, if
they had my gowns and my grooming, that
they could win and keep love, which seems to
be about all a woman wants. But these
things are, in reality, as useless as painting the
house when the thermometer is below zero and
you need a fire inside to warm your hands by.
I have imported gowns and real lace and furs
and jewels and all the grooming I'm willing
to take, but my soul is frozen and starved.</p>

<p>"My house," she went on, "isn't a mansion,
but it has all the comforts anyone could
reasonably require. As far as my taste can
discover, it's artistic and even unusual. The
dinner my cook sends up every night is as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
good, or better than any first-class hotel can
serve, though it may not be quite so elaborate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The One
Thing
Lacking</div>

<p>"I myself am not so bad to look at, I am
well dressed, and never untidy. I am disgustingly
well, which is fortunate, for most men
hate a sick woman. If I have a headache I
don't speak of it. I neither nag nor fret nor
scold, and I even have a few parlour tricks
which other people consider attractive. For
six years, I have given generously and from a
full heart everything he has seemed to require
of me.</p>

<p>"I've striven in every way to please him,
adapting myself to his tastes. I've even been
the sort of woman men call 'a good fellow,'
admiringly among women and contemptuously
among themselves. And, in return, I
have nothing&mdash;not even the fairy gold that
changes to withered leaves when you take it
into the sunshine."</p>

<p>"You seem to have a good deal, dear&mdash;youth
and health and strength and sufficient
income. How many women would be glad
to have what you have?"</p>

<p>"I want love," cried Edith, piteously. "I
want someone to care for me&mdash;to be proud of
me for what I am and the little things I can
do! If I painted a hideous dog on a helpless
china plate, I'd want someone to think it was
pretty. If I cooked a mess in the chafing-dish
or on the stove, I'd want someone to think it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
was good, just because I did it! If I embroidered
a red rose on a pink satin sofa cushion, or
painted a Winter scene on a wooden snow-shovel
and hung it up in the parlour, I'd
want someone to think it was beautiful. If I
wrote a limerick, I'd want someone to think
it was clever. I want appreciation, consideration,
sympathy, affection! I'm starving for
love, I'm dying for it, and I'd go across the
desert on my knees for the man who could give
it to me!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kisses
Classified</div>

<p>"Perhaps he cares," said Madame, consolingly,
"and doesn't show it."</p>

<p>"You can tell by the way a man kisses you
whether he cares or not. If he doesn't kiss
you at all, he doesn't care and doesn't even
mind your knowing it. If he kisses you dutifully,
without a trace of feeling, and, by preference,
on your cheek or neck, he doesn't care
but thinks he ought to, and hopes you won't
find out that he doesn't. But, if he cares&mdash;ah,
how it thrills you if he cares!"</p>

<p>Madame's violet eyes grew dim. "I know,"
she said, brokenly, "for I had it all once, long
ago. People used to say that marriage changes
love, but, with us, it only grew and strengthened.
The beginning was no more the fulness
of love than an acorn is the oak tree
which springs from it. We had our trials, our
differences, and our various difficulties, but
they meant nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">It May
Come</div>

<p>"I've had almost all the experiences of
life," she continued, clearing her throat.
"The endless cycle of birth and death has
passed on its way through me. I've known
poverty, defeat, humiliation, doubt, grief,
discouragement, despair. I've had illness and
death; I've borne children only to lose them
again. I've worked hard and many times
I've had to work alone, but I've had love,
though all I have left of it is a sunken grave."</p>

<p>"And I," answered Edith, "have had
everything else but love. Believe me, I'd
take all you've had, even the grave, if I could
have it once."</p>

<p>"It may come," said Madame, hopefully.</p>

<p>Edith shook her head. "That's what I'm
afraid of."</p>

<p>"How so? Why be afraid?"</p>

<p>"You see," she explained, "I'm young yet
and I'm not so desperately unattractive as
my matrimonial experiences might lead one
to believe. I haven't known there was
another man on earth except my husband,
but his persistent neglect has made me open
my eyes a little, and I begin to see others, on
a far horizon. Red blood has a way of
answering to red blood, whether there are
barriers between or not, and if I loved another
man, and he were unscrupulous&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," objected the older woman, "you
couldn't love an unscrupulous man."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Like the
Circus</div>

<p>"Couldn't I? My dear, when I see the
pitiful specimens of manhood that women
love, the things they give, the sacrifices they
make, the neglect and desertions they suffer
from, the countless humiliations they strive to
bear proudly, I wonder that any one of us
dares to look in the mirror.</p>

<p>"It's the eternal woman-hunger for love
that makes us what we are, compels us to
endure what we do, and keeps us all door-mats
with 'Welcome' printed on us in red letters.
Eagerly trustful, we keep on buying tickets
to the circus, and never discover until we're
old and grey, that it's always exactly the
same entertainment, and we're admitted to
it, each time, by a different door.</p>

<p>"Sometimes we see the caged wild animals
first, and again, we arrive at the pink-lemonade
stand; or, up at the other end, where
the trapezes are, or in the middle, opposite
the tank. Sometimes the band plays and
sometimes it doesn't, but all you need in
order to be thoroughly disillusioned is to stay
to the concert, which bears about the same
relation to the circus that marriage does to
your anticipations."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid," laughed Madame, "that
you'll buy another ticket?"</p>

<p>"No, but I'll find it, or somebody will give
me a pass. I'm too young to stay to the
concert and there's more of life coming to me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
still. I only hope and pray that I'll manage
to keep my head and not make the fatal, heart-breaking
mistake of the women who go over
the precipice, waving defiance at the social
law that bids them stay with the herd."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mixed
Metaphors</div>

<p>"Your metaphors are mixed," Madame
commented. "Concerts and circuses, and
herds, and precipices and door-mats. I feel
as though you had presented me with a jig-saw
puzzle."</p>

<p>"So I have. Is my life anything more than
that? I don't even know that all the pieces
are there. If they would only print the
picture on the cover of the box, or tell us how
many pieces there are, and give us more than
one or two at a time, and eternity to solve it in,
we'd stand some chance, perhaps."</p>

<p>"More mixed metaphors," Madame said,
rolling up the mended stockings.</p>

<p>A maid came into the dining-room and
began to set the table for luncheon. Edith
rose from her chair and came to Madame.
The dark hollows under her eyes were evident
now and all the youth was gone from her face
and figure.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, in a low tone, "what am I
to do?"</p>

<p>It was some little time before Madame
answered. "I do not know. These modern
times are too confused for me. The old way
would have been to wait, to do the best one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
could, and trust God to make it right in His
own good time."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Invited to
Stay</div>

<p>Edith shook her head. "I've waited and
I've done the best I could, and I've tried to
trust."</p>

<p>"No one can solve a problem for another,
but, I think, when it's time to act, one knows
what to do and the way is clearly opened for
one to do it. Don't you feel better for having
come here and talked to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said the young woman,
gratefully. "So much was right&mdash;I'm sure
of that. The train had scarcely started before
I felt more at peace than I had for years."</p>

<p>"Then, dear, won't you stay with me until
you know just what to do?"</p>

<p>Edith looked long and earnestly into the
sweet old face. "Do you mean it? It may
be a long time."</p>

<p>"I mean it&mdash;no matter how long it is."</p>

<p>Quick tears sprang to the brown eyes, and
Edith brushed them aside, half ashamed. "It
means more trunks," she said, "and your
son&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will be delighted to have you with us,"
Madame concluded.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely." Madame was not at all sure,
but she told her lie prettily.</p>

<p>"Then," said Edith, with a smile, "I'll
stay."</p>

<h2 class="chaphead">A Spring Day</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Alden's
Idea of a
Trunk</div>

<p>With the tact that seems the birthright of
the gifted few, Mrs. Lee adjusted herself
to the ways of the Marsh household.
Some commotion had been caused by the
arrival of four more trunks, of different shapes
and sizes, but after they had been unpacked
and stored, things went on smoothly.</p>

<p>Alden's idea of a trunk had hitherto been
very simple. To him, it was only a substantial
box, variation in size and in exterior finish
being the only possible diversions from the
original type. When it fell to his lot, on a
Saturday morning, to superintend the removal
of Mrs. Lee's empty trunks to the attic, he
discovered the existence of hat trunks, dresser
trunks, and wardrobe trunks, cannily constructed
with huge warts on all sides but the
one the trunk was meant to stand upon.</p>

<p>"Why so scornful?" a sweet voice asked, at
his elbow.</p>

<p>"I'm not scornful," he returned. "I'm
merely interested."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">In the
Hall</div>

<p>"You're fortunate," she smiled, "to be so
easily interested."</p>

<p>"We're out of the world here, you know,
and unfamiliar varieties of the trunk species
make me feel much as Crusoe did when he came
upon a human footprint in the sand."</p>

<p>"I wonder," mused Mrs. Lee, "how he really
did feel. It must have been dramatic beyond
all words."</p>

<p>She sat down on the window-seat in the hall
and leaned back against the casement of the
open window. The warm Spring wind, laden
with the sweet scent of growing things, played
caressingly about her neck and carried to Alden
a subtle fragrance of another sort. Her turquoise-blue
silk kimono, delicately embroidered
in gold, was open at the throat and fastened at
the waist with a heavy golden cord. Below, it
opened over a white petticoat that was a mass
of filmy lace ruffles. Her tiny feet peeped out
beneath the lace, clad in pale blue silk stockings
and fascinating Chinese slippers that
turned up at the toes.</p>

<p>From above came discordant rumblings
and eloquent, but smothered remarks on the
general subject of trunks. Mrs. Lee laughed.
"They're trying to make the wardrobe-trunk
stand up on the wrong end, and it won't."</p>

<p>"How do you know that's it?"</p>

<p>"Because I've heard the same noises and the
same general trend of conversation all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
way from the Atlantic to the Pacific and back
again. The farther west you go, the more
accomplished the men are in the art of profanity."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sounds
from the
Attic</div>

<p>"Is it an art? I thought it came naturally."</p>

<p>"It does, to some, but you have no idea
what study and constant practice can do in
developing a natural gift."</p>

<p>The sunlight illumined her hair into a mass
of spun gold that sparkled and gleamed and
shone. It made golden lights in her brown
eyes, caressed the ivory softness of her skin,
and deepened the scarlet of her lips.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said. "Isn't it awful?"</p>

<p>"No," returned Alden, "it isn't. In fact,
I don't know of any sound I'd rather hear
than your trunks being put into our attic."</p>

<p>A faint suggestion of a dimple appeared
at the corner of her mouth, then vanished.
"Well done," she said. "You have atoned
nobly for your dismay the night I came, when
you found I'd brought a trunk."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't," he replied, awkwardly.
"It wasn't that."</p>

<p>"Such a small trunk," she went on, mercilessly.
"Just a plain little steamer trunk
that you can put under a bed. The kind you
can ask a cabman to take down to the cab for
you. A little trunk that a woman can almost
carry herself! Only room for one gown, one
hat, and a few toilet articles!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Always
Too Late</div>

<p>The golden lights in her eyes were dancing
and her hair shimmered in the sun. Alden sat
down at the farthest end of the window-seat
and looked out upon the vineyard, faintly
green, now, with the new leaves. The two
men descended from the attic and went down
the back stairs.</p>

<p>"How did Robinson Crusoe feel when he
saw the footprint?" he asked, determined to
get away from the unlucky subject of trunks.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Edith answered, "for I
wasn't there. He must have been surprised
and frightened and pleased all at once. How
interesting it must be to have something happen
to you that never happened to anybody
before!"</p>

<p>"But it's all happened before," he objected.
"Is there anything new under the sun?"</p>

<p>"It's been new, at one time or another.
We're always too late, that's all. Somebody
ate the first oyster and somebody went to sleep
first and somebody wore the first false hair.</p>

<p>"No," she continued, with a rose-pink flush
mantling her face, "I don't. If I did, I
wouldn't mind saying so, but Nature gave me
quantities of it, so why should I borrow more?
Besides, I don't believe there is any more like
it, so I couldn't, anyway."</p>

<p>"No," he returned, thoughtfully, "I don't
believe there is any more like it, either. Your
wish to be first in something is surely gratified,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
for there never was such hair as yours and
never will be again."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Red Hair
and
Auburn</div>

<p>"Mother's was like it."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, it wasn't. I
never saw your mother, but I know better
than that."</p>

<p>"Ask your mother. There she is now."</p>

<p>Madame appeared at the head of the stairs,
on the way to her room, to dress for luncheon.
She paused to smile at the two who sat on the
window-seat, then would have gone straight on
had not Edith called to her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Marsh! Isn't my hair exactly like
my mother's?"</p>

<p>Madame came to her, turned the shining
head a little more toward the sun, and patted
the fluffiness caressingly. "No," she said,
"though your mother had glorious hair, it was
nothing like this. Hers was auburn and
smooth, yours is reddish-gold&mdash;almost copper-coloured&mdash;and
fluffy. Besides, you must have
nearly twice as much of it."</p>

<p>"There," said Alden, "I told you so."</p>

<p>"But," persisted Edith, "if it's really
copper-coloured, it's common. Look at the
lady on the copper cent, for instance."</p>

<p>"The lady on the copper cent," returned
Alden, "is a gentleman who wears feathers."</p>

<p>"But under his feathers he has hair the
colour of this."</p>

<p>"He may not have any hair at all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">What's
the
Matter
with Her?</div>

<p>They both laughed, and Madame smiled,
though she did not quite understand what
they were talking about. She was still smiling
when she reached her own room, for she found
it very pleasant to have Edith there, and was
delighted to have Alden come to a realising
sense of his duties as host.</p>

<p>He had, indeed, conducted himself admirably
ever since Mrs. Lee's arrival, though he
had been very quiet and reserved at first.
With some trepidation, she had told him that
she had invited the guest to remain indefinitely,
tactfully choosing a moment after an unusually
good dinner, when they chanced to be alone.</p>

<p>Alden had taken it calmly, betraying no
outward sign of any sort of emotion. "What's
the matter with her?" he had asked, curiously.
"What's she in trouble about?"</p>

<p>"If she wants you to know, my son, she will
tell you herself," Madame had replied, in a
tone of gentle rebuke. "I have no right to
violate her confidence."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders good-humouredly.
"You don't need to squelch me like that,
Mother. I don't know that I care, particularly.
I was merely making conversation."</p>

<p>"Refined conversation is not made of
impertinences," Madame suggested. The words
were harsh, but the tone was kind.</p>

<p>"Don't stab me with epigrams, please, for
I don't believe I deserve it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dream-Children</div>

<p>Madame recalled every word they had said
as she took down her afternoon gown of
black silk, and began to sew frills of real lace
in the neck and sleeves. She was glad he had
been pleasant about it, for it seemed much
more like living, someway, to have another
woman in the house.</p>

<p>If Virginia had lived&mdash;she, too, had brown
eyes, but her hair was brown also. She would
have been four years older than Edith was
now, and, undoubtedly, married. All Madame's
feminine ancestors for generations back
had been married. The only spinster in the
family, so far as Madame knew, had remained
true to the memory of a dead lover.</p>

<p>"Some women are born to be married, some
achieve marriage, and others have marriage
thrust upon them," Madame said to herself,
unconsciously paraphrasing an old saying.
Virginia would have been meant for it, too,
and, by now, there would have been children
in the old house, pattering back and forth upon
the stairs, lisping words that meant no more
than the bubbling of a fountain, and stretching
up tiny hands that looked like crumpled rose-petals,
pleading to be taken up and loved.</p>

<p>These dream-children tugged strangely at
the old lady's heart-strings in her moments
of reverie. Even yet, after Rosemary came&mdash;but
they would not be like her own flesh and
blood, as a daughter's children always are.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Poor Rosemary! How miserable she was at
home, and how little she would need to make
her happy! To think that she dared not tell
her Grandmother and Aunt that she was
engaged to Alden! Madame's cheeks grew
warm with resentment in the girl's behalf.
Motherless, friendless, alone, with Life's great
cup of wonder in her rough, red hands!</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Fussed
Over"</div>

<p>A tap at the door made her start. "Come
in!" she called.</p>

<p>It was Edith, trig and tailor-made, in dark
green, with a crisp white linen shirtwaist,
an immaculate collar, and a dashing green
tie.</p>

<p>"Mr. Marsh has invited me to go for a drive
after luncheon," she said, "and he asked me
to come and see if you weren't almost ready.
May I do your hair for you?"</p>

<p>Madame submitted, not because she cared
to have her hair done, but because she liked
to be "fussed over," as she put it. There was
something very pleasant in the touch of
Edith's cool, soft hands.</p>

<p>"You're&mdash;you're not going to change the
way I do it, are you?" she asked, a little
anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, indeed! I wouldn't change it for
anything. It suits you just as it is."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you think so, for I've always
worn it like this. Alden wouldn't know me
if I became fashionable."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">It Isn't
Right</div>

<p>"He doesn't look a bit like you," said
Edith, irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"No, but he's the living image of his father,
and I'm very glad. It keeps me from&mdash;from
missing him too much," Madame's voice
broke a little on the last words.</p>

<p>"It must be lovely to be missed," said Edith,
quickly. "Now I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear, haven't you told him yet?"</p>

<p>"He's probably discovered it by this time.
Still, I don't know&mdash;I've only been away a
week."</p>

<p>"It isn't right," said Madame, decidedly.
"You must let him know where you are."</p>

<p>"Why? I never know where he is."</p>

<p>"That doesn't make any difference. Two
wrongs never make one perfect right. If you
do your part, things will be only half wrong,
instead of entirely so."</p>

<p>"I'll do whatever you think best," said
Edith, humbly. "I came to you because I
could think for myself no longer. I'll write
him a note before luncheon, if you say so, and
post it this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I do say so."</p>

<p>Therefore luncheon waited for a few
moments, to Alden's secret impatience, until
Edith came down with her note. She offered
it to Madame, doubtfully. "Want to see it?"</p>

<p>"No, dear. I'll trust you."</p>

<p>She sealed it with shamefaced gladness that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Madame had not availed herself of the opportunity.
She was quite sure that her counsellor
would not approve of the few formal lines
which were all she had been able to make herself
write.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the
Way to
the Post-Office</div>

<p>After luncheon, when Alden assisted her into
Madame's decrepit phaeton, and urged the
superannuated horse into a wildly exciting
pace of three miles an hour, she asked to be
driven to the post-office.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Alden, "for alluding to
it as a drive. It's more like a walk."</p>

<p>"It isn't exactly like going out in a touring
car," she admitted, "but it's very pleasant,
nevertheless. It gives you time to look at the
scenery."</p>

<p>"Also to photograph it if you should so
desire. You don't even need to limit yourself
to snap-shots. A time-exposure is altogether
possible."</p>

<p>When they reached the post-office, Alden
took her note, and went through the formality
of tying the horse. He glanced at the superscription,
not because he was interested in her
unknown correspondent, but because the handwriting
claimed his attention. Through the
delicate angular tracery he made out the
address: "Mr. William G. Lee." The street
and number were beyond his skill in the brief
time he had at his command.</p>

<p>"So," he said, when he came back, "you're<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Mrs. William G. I trust you don't call him
'William'?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mrs.
William
G.</div>

<p>"No&mdash;he's the sort of William who is always
known as 'Billy.'"</p>

<p>"Good! That speaks well for him."</p>

<p>Alden began to wonder, as he alternately
coaxed and threatened the horse toward the
river-road, what manner of man she had married.
Someone, undoubtedly, with the face
and figure of Apollo, the courtesy of Chesterfield,
and the character of a saint. "It was
good of him," he said, gratefully, "to let you
come to us."</p>

<p>Edith bit her lips and turned her face away.
"I was glad to come," she answered, after a
pause. For a moment she trembled upon the
verge of a confidence, then summoned all her
conversational powers to the rescue.</p>

<p>She began with the natural beauty of the
country through which they were driving,
observed that the roads were better adapted
to a horse than to an automobile, noted the
pleasant situation of the Marsh house on the
river shore, veered for a moment to the subject
of good roads in France, came back to the
blue reflection of the sky upon the smooth
surface of the river, admired the situation of
the vineyard, said that Madame's phaeton was
extremely comfortable, and concluded by
asking if it wasn't almost time for apple-blossoms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">"I Just
Knew!"</div>

<p>"All of which means," said Alden, quietly,
"that you're unhappily married."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" demanded Edith,
crimson with surprise and mortification. "Did&mdash;did
your mother tell you?"</p>

<p>"No, she didn't&mdash;most decidedly she didn't.
I just know, that's all."</p>

<p>"How? Do I betray myself so completely
as that?"</p>

<p>He answered her question by another.
"How did you know, the night you came, that
I was surprised and not altogether pleased by
the fact that you had brought a trunk? Were
my manners as bad as all that?"</p>

<p>"Why, no&mdash;I just knew."</p>

<p>"And how did you know, this morning,
when we were sitting on the window-seat,
that I was wondering whether or not you wore
false hair?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I just knew."</p>

<p>"That's it, exactly."</p>

<p>"How long have you&mdash;known?"</p>

<p>"Ask me something easier than that," he
laughed, endeavouring to relieve a situation
that threatened to become awkward. Following
his lead, she began to ask questions
about the vineyard, and, when he told her he
feared he knew very little about his work,
suggested that he should read up on vine-culture
and make it the best-paying vineyard
in the State.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">An
Afternoon
Drive</div>

<p>"Has mother been talking to you?" he
demanded, turning to her quickly.</p>

<p>"About the vineyard? No. But, if it's
your work, why not do it better than anybody
else does it?"</p>

<p>Alden looked at her long and earnestly.
The golden lights of her eyes were thrown into
shadow now, for it was afternoon and they
were driving east. Her answering smile
gave him confidence, courage. Moreover, it
challenged him in some subtle way he could
not analyse. It dared him, as it were, to
make the best of the vineyard&mdash;and himself.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, at length. "I
believe&mdash;I will."</p>

<p>The divine moment passed, and, for the
remainder of the drive, they talked commonplaces.
But the fresh air from the hills, the
freedom of the wind-swept spaces, the steady
aspiration of everything that lived, brought
the colour to Edith's cheeks, the sparkle to her
eyes, and ministered secretly to her soul.
When she went in, she looked happier than
she had since she came. Madame saw it and
was glad, but wisely said nothing.</p>

<p>She came down at dinner-time in a black
lace gown trimmed with spangles that glittered
when she moved. It was cut away slightly
from the rounded, ivory throat, and the white
arms were bare to the elbow. The upper parts
of the sleeves were made of black velvet ribbon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
latticed into small diamond-shaped openings
through which the satin texture of the skin
showed in the candlelight. She wore no rings,
except the slender circlet of gold that had been
put on her finger at the altar, six years ago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Sense
of
Foreboding</div>

<p>Conversation at dinner proceeded slowly,
but on pleasant lines. Edith seemed preoccupied,
and, at times, Alden relapsed into
long silences. Madame noted that they
scarcely spoke to each other, and was vaguely
troubled, for she liked Edith, and wanted
Alden to like her too.</p>

<p>After dinner, Edith played cribbage with
Madame and Alden read the paper. When
Madame had won three games, in rapid succession,
Edith said good-night. Alden, from the
depths of his paper, murmured the conventional
response.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>That night he started from his sleep with a
sense of foreboding. He sat up and listened,
but there was no sound. Not even the wind
moving a shutter, nor a swaying branch tapping
at his window&mdash;not a footfall, nor an
echo, nor a breath.</p>

<p>The tall clock on the landing struck four.
The silvery strokes died away into a silence
that was positive, rather than negative. The
sense of foreboding still persisted; moreover,
he was conscious that someone else was awake
also.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A
Mysterious
Perception</div>

<p>Was it his mother? Was she ill? No&mdash;he
was sure of that. Was it Edith? Yes, that
was it. She was awake, and had been awake
all night. Moreover, she was crying.</p>

<p>His heart throbbed with tender pity. He
yearned to comfort her, to assure her that
whatever was wrong must eventually be made
right. Why, from the crown of her beautiful
head to the turned-up toe of her blue Chinese
slipper, Edith had been made for joy&mdash;and for
love.</p>

<p>Out of the darkness came a sudden mysterious
perception. She knew she had awakened
him, and had smiled at the knowledge.
A sense of weariness quickly followed, then a
restful silence which carried no thought with
it.</p>

<p>He lay back on his pillow and waited, with
his eyes closed, until he felt that she was
asleep. Then he slept also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Letter
for
Rosemary</div>

<p>Rosemary peered into the letter box and
saw that <i>The Household Guardian</i> was
there. On one Thursday it had failed to
appear and she had been unable to convince
Grandmother of her entire innocence in the
matter. Even on the following day, when
she brought it home, in the original wrapping,
she felt herself regarded with secret suspicion.
As it never had failed to come on Thursday,
why should it, unless Rosemary, for some
reason best known to herself, had tampered
with the United States Mail?</p>

<p>There was also a letter, and Rosemary
waited eagerly for the postmaster to finish
weighing out two pounds of brown sugar and
five cents' worth of tea for old Mrs. Simms.
She pressed her nose to the glass, and squinted,
but the address eluded her. Still, she was sure
it was for her, and, very probably, from Alden,
whom she had not seen for ten days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ways and
Means</div>

<p>She felt a crushing sense of disappointment
when she saw that it was not from Alden, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
was addressed in an unfamiliar hand. Regardless
of the deference she was accustomed
to accord a letter, she tore it open hastily and
read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Rosemary</span>:</p>

<p>"Can you come to tea on Saturday afternoon
about four? We have a guest whom I am
sure you would like to meet.</p></div>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">"Affectionately, your</p>
<p style="margin-left:50%;">"<span class="smcap">Mother</span>."</p>

<p>The words were formal enough, and the
quaint stateliness of the handwriting conveyed
its own message of reserve and distance
but the signature thrilled her through
and through. "Mother!" she repeated, in a
whisper. She went out of the post-office
blindly, with the precious missive tightly
clasped in her trembling hand.</p>

<p>Would she go? Of course she would, even
though it meant facing Grandmother, Aunt
Matilda, and all the dogs of war.</p>

<p>As the first impulse faded, she became
more cautious, and began to consider ways
and means. It was obviously impossible to
wear brown gingham or brown alpaca to a
tea-party. That meant that she must somehow
get her old white muslin down from the
attic, iron it, mend it, and freshen it up as
best she could. She had no doubt of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
ability to do it, for both old ladies were sound
sleepers, and Rosemary had learned to step
lightly, in bare feet, upon secret errands
around the house at night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secret
Longings</div>

<p>But how could she hope to escape, unobserved,
on Saturday afternoon? And, even if
she managed to get away, what of the inevitable
return? Why not, for once, make a bold
declaration of independence, and say, calmly:
"Grandmother, I am going to Mrs. Marsh's
Saturday afternoon at four, and I am going to
wear my white dress." Not "May I go?" or
"May I wear it?" but "I am going," and "I
am going to wear it."</p>

<p>At the thought Rosemary shuddered and
her soul quailed within her. She knew that
she would never dare to do it. At the critical
moment her courage would fail her, and she
would stay at home. Perhaps she could wear
the brown gingham if it were fresh and clean,
and she pinned at her throat a bow of the
faded pink ribbon she had found in her mother's
trunk in the attic. And, if it should happen
to rain Saturday, or even look like rain, so
much the better. Anyhow, she would go,
even in the brown gingham. So much she
decided upon.</p>

<p>Yet, with all her heart, she longed for the
white dress, the only thing she had which even
approached daintiness. An old saying came
back to her in which she had found consola<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>tion
many times before. "When an insurmountable
obstacle presents itself, sometimes
there is a way around it." And, again, "Take
one step forward whenever there is a foothold
and trust to God for the next."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Bit of
News</div>

<p>That night, at supper, Aunt Matilda electrified
Grandmother with a bit of news which she
had jealously kept to herself all day.</p>

<p>"The milkman was telling me," she remarked,
with an assumed carelessness which
deceived no one, "that there's company up to
Marshs'."</p>

<p>Grandmother dropped her knife and fork
with a sharp clatter. "You don't tell me!"
she cried. "Who in creation is it?"</p>

<p>"I was minded to tell you before," Aunt
Matilda resumed, with tantalising deliberation,
"but you've had your nose in that fool
paper all day, and whenever I spoke to you
you told me not to interrupt. Literary folks
is terrible afraid of bein' interrupted, I've
heard, so I let you alone."</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was anything important,"
murmured Grandmother, apologetically.</p>

<p>"How could you know," questioned Matilda,
logically, "before I'd told you what it
was?"</p>

<p>There being no ready answer to this, Grandmother
responded with a snort, which meant
much or little, as one might choose. A dull
red burned on her withered cheeks and she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
lost interest in her supper. Only Rosemary
was calm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Play-Actin'
Person</div>

<p>"As I was sayin'," Matilda went on, after
an aggravating silence, "there's company up
to Marshs'."</p>

<p>"Seems to me," Grandmother grunted,
"that she'd better be payin' up the calls she
owes in the neighbourhood than entertainin'
strangers." This shaft pierced a vulnerable
spot in Matilda's armour of self-esteem, for
she still smarted under Madame Marsh's
neglect.</p>

<p>"The milkman says it's a woman. Her
name's Mis' Lee. She come a week ago and
last Saturday she was to the post-office, and up
the river-road all the afternoon in that old
phaeton with young Marsh."</p>

<p>Rosemary's heart paused for a moment,
then resumed its beat.</p>

<p>"She's a play-actin' person, he says, or at
any rate she looks like one, which amounts
to the same thing. She's brought four trunks
with her&mdash;one respectable trunk, same as anybody
might have, one big square trunk that
looks like a dog-house, and another big trunk
that a person could move into if there wasn't
no other house handy, and another trunk that
was packed so full that it had bulged out on all
sides but one, and when Jim and Dick took
it up into the attic there wasn't but one side
they could set it on. And whiles they was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
findin' a place to set it, she and young Marsh
was laughin' down in the hall."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Servant's
Gossip</div>

<p>"Who is she?" demanded Grandmother.
"Where did she come from? How long is she
goin' to stay? Where'd Mis' Marsh get to
know her?"</p>

<p>"The milkman's wife was over last Monday,"
Matilda continued, "to help with the
washin', and she says she never see such
clothes in all her born days nor so many of 'em.
They was mostly lace, and she had two white
petticoats in the wash. The stocking was all
silk, and she said she never see such nightgowns.
They was fine enough for best summer
dresses, and all lace, and one of 'em had a
blue satin bow on it, and what was strangest
of all was that there wa'n't no place to get into
'em. They was made just like stockin's with
no feet to 'em, and if she wore 'em, she'd
have to crawl in, either at the bottom or the
top. She said she never see the beat of those
nightgowns."</p>

<p>"Do tell!" ejaculated Grandmother.</p>

<p>"And her hair looks as if she ain't never
combed it since the day she was born. The
milkman says it looks about like a hen's nest
and is pretty much the same colour. He see
her on the porch for a minute, and all he could
look at was that hair. And when he passed 'em
on the river-road after they come from the
post-office, he couldn't see her hair at all,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
cause she had on a big hat tied on with some
thin light blue stuff. He reckoned maybe
her hair was a wig."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discussing
the
Stranger</div>

<p>"I'd know whether 'twas a wig or not, if I
saw it once," Grandmother muttered. "There
ain't nobody that can fool me about false
hair."</p>

<p>"I guess you ain't likely to see it," retorted
Matilda, viciously. "All we'll ever hear
about her'll be from the milk folks."</p>

<p>"Maybe I could see her," ventured Rosemary,
cautiously. "I could put on my best
white dress and go to see Mrs. Marsh, to-morrow
or next day, after I get the work done
up. I could find out who she was and all
about her, and come back and tell you."</p>

<p>For an instant the stillness was intense,
then both women turned to her. "You!"
they said, scornfully, in the same breath.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Grandmother, after an impressive
pause, "I reckon you'll be puttin' on
your best dress and goin' up to Marshs' to see
a play-actin' woman."</p>

<p>"You'd have lots to do," continued Aunt
Matilda, "goin' to see a woman what ain't seen
fit to return a call your Aunt made on her
more'n five years ago."</p>

<p>"Humph!" Grandmother snorted.</p>

<p>"The very idea," exclaimed Aunt Matilda.</p>

<p>What had seemed to Rosemary like an open
path had merely led to an insurmountable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
stone wall. She shrugged her shoulders good-humouredly.
"Very well," she said, "I'm
sure I don't care. Suit yourselves."</p>

<div class="sidenote">One Step
Forward</div>

<p>She began to clear away the supper dishes,
for, though the others had eaten little, they
had apparently finished. Out in the kitchen,
she sang as she worked, and only a close
observer would have detected a tremor in
the sweet, untrained soprano. "Anyway,"
thought Rosemary, "I'll put on the flat-irons."</p>

<p>The fire she had built would not go out for
some hours. She had used coal ruinously in
order to heat the oven for a special sort of tea-biscuit
of which Grandmother was very fond.
While the fire was going out, it would heat the
irons, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"One step forward whenever there is a foothold,"
she said to herself, "and trust to God
for the next."</p>

<p>That night, as fortune would have it,
Grandmother and Aunt Matilda elected to sit
up late, solving a puzzle in <i>The Household
Guardian</i> for which a Mission rocker was
offered as a prize. It was long past ten
o'clock when they gave it up.</p>

<p>"I dunno," yawned Aunt Matilda, "as I'm
partial to rockers."</p>

<p>"Leastways," continued Grandmother, rising
to put her spectacles on the mantel, "to
the kind they give missionaries. I've seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
the things they send missionaries more'n
once, in my time."</p>

<div class="sidenote">More than
One Way</div>

<p>By eleven, the household slept, except
Rosemary. As silently as a ghost, she made
her way to the attic, brought down the clean
white muslin, and, with irons scarcely hot
enough, pressed it into some semblance of
freshness. She hung it in her closet, under the
brown alpaca of two seasons past, and went
to sleep, peacefully.</p>

<p>Bright and early the next morning the Idea
presented itself. Why not put on the white
gown with one of the brown ones over it and
take off the brown one when she got there?
Mrs. Marsh would understand.</p>

<p>Rosemary laughed happily as she climbed
out of bed. Surely there was more than one
way of cheating Fate! That afternoon, while
the others took their accustomed "forty
winks," she brought down the faded pink
ribbon that had been her mother's. That
night she discovered that neither of the
brown ginghams would go over the white
muslin, as they had shrunk when they were
washed, but that the alpaca would. There
was not even a bit of white showing beneath
the skirt, as she had discovered by tilting her
mirror perilously forward.</p>

<p>She was up early Saturday morning, and
baked and swept and dusted to such good purpose
that, by three o'clock, there was nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
more that anyone could think of for her
to do until it was time to get supper. She
had put the white gown on under the alpaca
when she dressed in the morning, as it was the
only opportunity of which she was at all sure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hung in
the
Balance</div>

<p>Grandmother and Aunt Matilda were nodding
in their chairs. The kitchen clock struck
the half hour. Finally, Rosemary spoke.</p>

<p>"Is there anything either of you would like
me to get at the store?"</p>

<p>"No," said Grandmother.</p>

<p>"No," echoed Aunt Matilda. Then she
added: "Why? Were you thinkin' of goin'
out?"</p>

<p>"I thought I would," said Rosemary, with
a yawn, "if there was nothing more for me to
do. It's such a nice day, and I'd like a
breath of fresh air."</p>

<p>For a moment, Fate hung in the balance,
then Grandmother said, generously: "Go
on, Rosemary, and get all the fresh air you
want. You've worked better'n common
to-day."</p>

<p>"I should think you'd be tired enough to
stay home and rest," Aunt Matilda commented,
fretfully, but the door had closed on
the last word, and Rosemary was gone.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But April's sun strikes down the glades to-day;<br /></span>

<div class="sidenote">Rosemary
Meets
Edith</div>

<p>The beautiful words sang themselves through
her memory as she sped on. She had forgotten
about the guest for the moment, remembering
with joy that almost hurt, the one
word "Mother," and the greater, probable
joy that overshadowed it. Of course he would
be there! Why not, when he knew she was
coming to tea&mdash;and when they had a guest,
too? The girl's heart beat tumultuously as
she neared the house, for through it, in great
tides, surged fear, and ecstasy&mdash;and love.</p>

<p>Madame herself opened the door. "Come
in, dear!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Marsh! Please, just a minute!"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Marsh again? I thought we were
mother and daughter. Edith!" she called.
Then, in the next moment, Rosemary found
herself in the living-room, offering a rough,
red hand to an exquisite creature who seemed
a blurred mass of pale green and burnished
gold, redolent of violets, and who murmured,
in a beautifully modulated contralto: "How
do you do, Miss Starr! I am very glad to
meet you."</p>

<p>The consciousness of the white gown underneath
filled Rosemary's eyes with tears of
mortification, which Madame hastened to
explain. "It's raw and cold still," she said,
"in spite of the calendar. These keen Spring
winds make one's eyes water. Here, my dear,
have a cup of tea."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">An
Uncomfortable
Afternoon</div>

<p>Rosemary took the cup with hands that
trembled, and, while she sipped the amber
fragrance of it, struggled hard for self-possession.
Madame ignored her for the moment
and chatted pleasantly with Edith. Then
Alden came in and shook hands kindly with
Rosemary, though he had been secretly
annoyed when he learned she was coming.
Afterward, he had a bad quarter of an hour
with himself while he endeavoured to find out
why. At last he had shifted the blame to
Edith, deciding that she would think Rosemary
awkward and countrified, and that it
would not be pleasant for him to stand by and
see it.</p>

<p>However, the most carping critic could have
found no fault with Edith's manner. If she
felt any superiority, she did not show it. She
accorded to Rosemary the same perfect
courtesy she showed Madame, and, apparently,
failed to notice that the girl had not spoken
since the moment of introduction.</p>

<p>She confined the conversation wholly to
things Rosemary must have been familiar
with&mdash;the country, the cool winds that sometimes
came when one thought it was almost
Summer, the perfect blend of Madame's tea,
the quaint Chinese pot, and the bad manners
of the canary, who seemed to take a fiendish
delight in scattering the seed that was given
him to eat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Looking
into the
Crystal
Ball</div>

<p>Rosemary merely sat in the corner, tried to
smile, and said, as required, "Yes," or "No."
Alden, pitying her from the depths of his
heart and yet secretly ashamed, tried unsuccessfully,
now and then, to draw her into the
conversation.</p>

<p>Edith drained her cup, affected disappointment
at finding no stray leaves by which she
might divine the future, then went to Rosemary,
and took the empty cup which she sat
holding with pathetic awkwardness.</p>

<p>"You have none, either, Miss Starr," she
said, sweetly. "Suppose we try the crystal
ball? I've been wanting to do it ever since I
came, but was afraid to venture, alone."</p>

<p>Rosemary, her senses whirling, followed her
over to the table, where the ball lay on its bit
of black velvet.</p>

<p>"How do you do it?" asked Edith, of
Madame.</p>

<p>"Just get into a good light, shade your eyes,
and look in."</p>

<p>"That's easy," Edith said. She bent over
the table, shaded her eyes with her white,
beautifully-kept hands, and peered into the
crystalline depths. "There's nothing here,"
she continued, somewhat fretfully, to Alden,
"except you. By some trick of reflection, I
could see you as plainly as though it were a
mirror. You try, Miss Starr."</p>

<p>Madame's heart contracted suddenly as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
remembered the day she had looked into the
crystal ball, and had seen not only Alden, but
a woman with flaming red hair, clasped closely
in his arms. "It's all nonsense," she tried to
say, but her stiff lips would not move.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Black
Cloud</div>

<p>Rosemary left the table and went back to
her corner. "What did you see?" queried
Edith. "Did you have any better luck than
I did?"</p>

<p>"No," Rosemary answered, with a degree
more of self-possession than she had shown
previously. "There was nothing there but a
black cloud."</p>

<p>The task of keeping up the conversation fell
to Edith and Alden, for Madame had unconsciously
withdrawn into herself as some small
animals shut themselves into their shells. All
were relieved, though insensibly, when Rosemary
said she must go.</p>

<p>Alden went into the hall with her, to help
her with her coat and hat, and, as opportunity
offered, to kiss her twice, shyly, on her cheek.
He wanted to go part way home with her, but
Rosemary refused.</p>

<p>"You'd better not," she said, "but thank
you just as much."</p>

<p>"Won't you even let me go to the corner
with you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Rosemary, with trembling lips,
"please don't."</p>

<p>So she went on alone, while Alden returned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
to the living-room. Edith was saying to
Madame: "Poor little brown mouse! How
one longs to take a girl like that and give her
all the pretty things she needs!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edith's
Desire for
Rosemary</div>

<p>Madame took the crystal ball, wrapped it in
its bit of velvet, and put it on the highest shelf
of the bookcase, rolling it back behind the
books, out of sight.</p>

<p>"Why do you do that, Mother?" asked
Alden, curiously. "Because," returned Madame,
grimly, "it's all nonsense. I won't
have it around any more."</p>

<p>Alden laughed, but Edith went on, thoughtfully:
"I'd like to do her hair for her, and
see that all her under-things were right, and
then put her into a cr&ecirc;pe gown of dull blue&mdash;a
sort of Chinese blue, with a great deal of
deep-toned lace for trimming, and give her a
topaz pendant set in dull silver, and a big
picture hat of ecru net, with a good deal of the
lace on it, and one long plume, a little lighter
than the gown."</p>

<p>"I would, too," said Alden, smiling at
Edith. He did not in the least know what
she was talking about, but he knew that she
felt kindly toward Rosemary, and was grateful
for it.</p>

<p>Rosemary, at home, went about her duties
mechanically. There was a far-away look in
her eyes which did not escape the notice of
Grandmother and Aunt Matilda, but they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
forebore to comment upon it as long as she
performed her tasks acceptably. At supper
she ate very little, and that little was as dust
and ashes in her mouth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heartburns</div>

<p>Before her, continually, was a heart-breaking
contrast. She, awkward, ugly, ill at ease
in brown alpaca made according to the fashion
of ten or fifteen years ago, and Mrs. Lee,
beautiful, exquisite, dainty to her finger-tips,
richly dowered with every conceivable thing
that she herself lacked.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Rosemary, to herself. "Oh,
Mother!" She did not mean Mrs. Marsh, but
the pretty, girlish mother who had died in giving
birth to her. She would have been like
Mrs. Lee, or prettier, and she would have
understood.</p>

<p>Her heart smarted and burned and ached,
but she got through the evening somehow,
and, at the appointed time, stumbled up to
her own room.</p>

<p>Why should she care because another
woman was prettier than she, knew more, and
had more? Were there not many such in the
world, and had she not Alden? Accidentally,
Rosemary came upon the cause of her pain.</p>

<p>Of course she had Alden, for always&mdash;unless&mdash;then,
once more, reassurance came.
"She's married," said Rosemary, smiling
back at the white, frightened face she saw in
the mirror. "She's married!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Comforting
Thought</div>

<p>The thought carried with it so much comfort
that presently Rosemary slept peacefully,
exhausted, as she was, by the stress
of the afternoon. "She's married," was her
last conscious thought, and a smile lingered
upon her lips as she slept. She had not enough
worldly wisdom to know that, other things
being equal, a married woman may be a dangerous
rival, having the unholy charm of the
unattainable, and the sanction of another
man's choice.</p>

<h2 class="gap3 chaphead"><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

<h2 class="chaphead">The Hour of the Turning Night</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Awake in
the Night</div>

<p>The darkness was vibrant, keen, alive.
It throbbed with consciousness, with
mysterious fibres of communication. There
was no sense of a presence in the room, nor
even the possibility of a presence. It was
vague, abstract, yet curiously definite.</p>

<p>Edith woke from a troubled dream with a
start. For a moment she lay quietly and
listened, not afraid, but interested, as though
upon the threshold of some new experience.
The scurrying feet of mice made a ghostly
patter in the attic, above her room, and a
vagrant wind, in passing, tapped at her window
with the fairy-like fingers of the vine
that clung to the wall.</p>

<p>Otherwise all was still, and yet the darkness
trembled with expectancy. Something hitherto
unknown seemed to have entered her consciousness,
some thought, emotion, instinct,
or what? Wide awake, staring into space, she
lay there, wondering, waiting, not in the least
frightened, but assured of shelter and of peace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Another
Personality</div>

<p>Gradually she had lost consciousness of her
body. She had relaxed completely and her
mind soared, free. She moved one foot,
cautiously, to see whether her body was still
there, and smiled when she was reassured by
the cool smoothness of the linen sheet, and the
other warm little foot she touched in moving.</p>

<p>Somewhere, in this same darkness, was
another personality. Of so much she eventually
became sure. It was not in the room,
perhaps not even in the house, but for someone
else, somewhere, was this same sense&mdash;of
communication? No, but rather the possibility
of it.</p>

<p>Someone else had also lost consciousness
of the body. Another mind, released for the
moment from its earthly prison, sought communion
with hers. Was this death, and had
she wakened in another world? She moved
her foot again, pressed her hand to the warm
softness of her breast, felt her breath come
and go, and even the steady beating of her
heart. Not death, then, only a pause, in
which for once the body, clamorous and
imperious with its thousand needs, had given
way to the soul.</p>

<p>The curious sense of another personality
persisted. Was this other person dead, and
striving mutely for expression? No, surely
not, for this other mind was on the same plane
as hers, subject to the same conditions. Not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
disembodied entirely, but only relaxed, as
she was, this other personality had wakened
and found itself gloriously free.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A New
Self</div>

<p>A perception of fineness followed. Not
everyone was capable of this, and the conviction
brought a pleasant sense of superiority.
Above the sordid world, in some higher realm
of space and thought, they two had met, and
saluted one another.</p>

<p>For the first time Edith thought of her
body as something separate from herself,
and in the light of a necessary&mdash;or unnecessary&mdash;evil.
This new self neither hungered nor
thirsted nor grew weary; it knew neither cold
nor heat nor illness; pain, like a fourth
dimension, was out of its comprehension, it
required neither clothes nor means of transportation,
it simply went, as the wind might,
by its own power, when and where it chose.</p>

<p>Whose mind was it? Was it someone she
knew, or someone she was yet to meet? And
in what bodily semblance did it dwell, when
it was housed in its prison? Was it a woman,
or a man? Not a woman&mdash;Edith instantly
dismissed the idea, for this sense of another
personality carried with it not the feeling of
duality or likeness, but of difference, of divine
completion.</p>

<p>Some man she knew, or whom she was to
know, freed for the moment from his earthly
environment, roamed celestial ways with her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
She was certain that it was not lasting, that,
at the best, it could be of very brief duration,
and this fact of impermanence was the very
essence of its charm, like life itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Who Was
the Man?</div>

<p>The clock down-stairs began to strike&mdash;one,
two, three&mdash;four. It was the hour of the night
when life is at its lowest, the point on the
flaming arc of human existence where it
touches the shadow of the unknown, softening
into death or brightening into life according
to the swing of the pendulum. Then, if ever,
the mind and body would be apart, Edith
thought, for when the physical forces sink, the
spirit must rise to keep the balance true.</p>

<p>Who was the man? Her husband? No,
for they were too far apart to meet like this.
She idly went over the list of her men acquaintances&mdash;old
schoolmates, friends of her
husband's, husbands of her friends, as one
might call the roll of an assembly, expecting
someone to rise and answer "Here."</p>

<p>Yet it was all in vain, though she felt herself
on the right track and approaching a
definite solution. The darkness clung about
her like a living thing. It throbbed as the
air may when a wireless instrument answers
another, leagues away; it was as eloquent of
communication as a network of telephone
and telegraph wires, submerged in midnight,
yet laden with portent of life and death.</p>

<p>She sat up in bed, straining every nerve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
to the point where all senses unite in one.
"Who are you?" Her lips did not move,
but the thought seemed to have the sound of
thunder in its imperious demand. Tangled
fibres of communication noiselessly wove
themselves through the darkness, and again
all her soul merged itself into one question&mdash;"Who?
For God's sake, who?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Answer</div>

<p>Then, after a tense instant of waiting, the
answer flashed upon her, vivid as lightning:
"Alden Marsh!"</p>

<p>And swiftly, as though in response to a call,
a definite, conscious thought from the other
personality presented itself: "Yes? What
would you have of me?"</p>

<p>Edith lay back among her pillows, as the
clock struck the half hour. The body, as
though resentful of denial, urged itself swiftly
upon her now. Her heart beat tumultuously,
her hands shook, she thrilled from head to
foot with actual physical pain. The darkness
no longer seemed alive, but negative and dead,
holding somewhere in its merciful depths the
promise of rest.</p>

<p>Utterly exhausted, she closed her eyes and
slept, to be roused by a tap at her door.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, drowsily, "come in!"</p>

<p>Madame came in, pulled up the shades and
flooded the room with sunshine. "I'm sorry
if I've disturbed you, dear, but I was afraid
you were ill. I've been here twice before."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aroused
from
Sleep</div>

<p>Edith sat up and rubbed her eyes. "What
time is it?"</p>

<p>"Half-past nine."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry! You mustn't spoil me
this way, for I do want to get up to breakfast.
Why didn't you call me?"</p>

<p>Madame sat down on the side of the bed
and patted Edith's outstretched hand with
affectionate reassurance. "You're to do just
as you please," she said, "but I was beginning
to worry a bit, for you've been the soul of
punctuality."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;" Edith closed her lips firmly upon
the instinctive question, "Did he miss me?"
She dismissed it as the mere vapouring of a
vacant brain.</p>

<p>"Did what?" asked Madame, helpfully.</p>

<p>"Did you miss me?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Alden did too. The last
thing he said before he went to school was
that he hoped you were not ill."</p>

<p>"That was nice of him." Edith put a small
pink foot out of bed on the other side and
gazed at it pensively. Madame laughed.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you've grown up," she
said. "You remind me of a small child, who
has just discovered her toes. Do you want
your breakfast up here?"</p>

<p>"No, I'll come down. Give me half an
hour and I'll appear before you, clothed and
in my right mind, with as humble an apology<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
for my sins as I'm able to compose in the
meantime."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Call of the
Wander-Lust</div>

<p>She was as good as her word, appearing
promptly at the time she had set, and dressed
for the street. After doing justice to a hearty
breakfast, she said that she was going out for
a walk and probably would not be back to
luncheon.</p>

<p>"My dear!" exclaimed Madame. "You
mustn't do that. I'll have luncheon kept
for you."</p>

<p>"No, please don't, for I really shan't want
any. Didn't you observe my breakfast?
Even a piano-mover couldn't think of eating
again before seven, so let me go a-gypsying
till sunset."</p>

<p>Madame nodded troubled acquiescence, and,
with a laugh, Edith kissed her good-bye.
"I'm subject to the Wander-lust," she said,
"and when the call comes, I have to go. It's
in my blood to-day, so farewell for the
present."</p>

<p>Madame watched her as she went down
the street, the golden quill on her green hat
bidding jaunty defiance to the wind. As she
had said, she felt the call at times, and had
to yield to its imperative summons, but to-day
it was her soul that craved the solace of the
open spaces and the wind-swept fields.</p>

<p>As she dressed, she had tried to dismiss
last night's experience as a mere fantasy of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
sleep, or, if not an actual dream, some vision
hailing from the borderland of consciousness,
at the point where the senses merge. Yet,
even as she argued with herself, she felt the
utter futility of it, and knew her denials were
vain in the face of truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roaming
through
the
Village</div>

<p>She dreaded the necessity of meeting Alden
again, then made a wry face at her own
foolishness. "Ridiculous," she said to herself,
"preposterous, absurd!" No matter what
her own nightmares might be, he slept soundly&mdash;of
course he did. How could healthy
youth with a clear conscience do otherwise?</p>

<p>For an hour or more, she kept to the streets
of the village, with the sublime unconsciousness
of the city-bred, too absorbed in her own
thoughts to know that she was stared at and
freely commented upon by those to whom a
stranger was a source of excitement. Her
tailored gown, of dark green broadcloth, the
severe linen shirtwaist, and her simple hat,
were subjects of conversation that night in
more than one humble home, fading into
insignificance only before her radiant hair.
The general opinion was that it must be a
wig, or the untoward results of some experiment
with hair-dye, probably the latter, for,
as the postmaster's wife said, "nobody would
buy a wig of that colour."</p>

<p>The school bell rang for dismissal, and filled
her with sudden panic. After walking through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the village all the morning to escape luncheon
with Alden, it would be disagreeable to meet
him face to face almost at the schoolhouse
door. Turning in the opposite direction, she
walked swiftly until she came to a hill, upon
which an irregular path straggled half-heartedly
upward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Finding of
the Red
Book</div>

<p>So Edith climbed the Hill of the Muses,
pausing several times to rest. When she
reached the top, she was agreeably surprised
to find a comfortable seat waiting her, even
though it was only a log rolled back against
two trees. She sank back into the hollow,
leaned against the supporting oak, and wiped
her flushed face.</p>

<p>Others had been there before her, evidently,
for the turf was worn around the log, and
there were even hints of footprints here and
there. "Some rural trysting place, probably,"
she thought, then a gleam of scarlet
caught her attention. A small red book had
fallen into the crevice between the log and the
other tree. "<i>The House of Life</i>," she murmured,
under her breath. "Now, who in
this little village would&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The book bore neither name nor initials,
but almost every page was marked. As it
happened, most of them were favourite passages
of her own. "How idyllic!" she mused;
"a pair of young lovers reading Rossetti on a
hill-top in Spring! Could anything be more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
pastoral? I'll take it back to the house and
tell about it at dinner."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mutually
Surprised</div>

<p>She welcomed it as a sure relief from a possible
awkward moment. "I knew I was
right," she said to herself, as she turned the
pages. "To-day was set aside, long ago, for
me to go a-gypsying."</p>

<p>The clear air of the heights and the sunlit
valley beneath her gave her a sense of proportion
and of value which she realised she
had sadly needed. Free from the annoyances
of her daily life, she could look back upon it
with due perspective, and see that her unhappiness
had been largely caused by herself.</p>

<p>"I can't be miserable," she thought, "unless
I'm willing to be."</p>

<p>She sat there for a long time, heedless of
the passing hours. She was roused from her
reverie by a muffled footstep and an involuntary
exclamation of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why, how do you do, Miss Starr?" said
Edith, kindly, offering a well-gloved hand.
"Are you out gypsying too?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Rosemary stammered. Her eyes
were fixed upon the small red book that Mrs.
Lee held in her other hand.</p>

<p>"See what I found," Edith went on, heedlessly.
"Rossetti's <i>House of Life</i>, up here.
Boy Blue must have brought it up to read to
Bo-Peep in the intervals of shepherding.
There may not be any such word as 'shep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>herding,'
but there ought to be, I love to
make words, don't you?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shrines
Laid Bare</div>

<p>"Yes," said Rosemary, helplessly. She
had thought Alden had the book, but had
forgotten to make sure, and now the most
precious hours of her life had been invaded
and her shrines laid bare. Was it not enough
for this woman to live in the same house with
Alden? Need she take possession of the Hill
of the Muses and the little book which had
first awakened her, then brought them together?
Resentful anger burned in her cheeks,
all the more pitiful because of Mrs. Lee's
utter unconsciousness, and the impossibility
of reparation, even had she known.</p>

<p>"Sit down," Edith suggested. "You must
be tired. It's a long climb."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;did you come up here to&mdash;to meet
anyone?" The suspicion broke hotly from
Rosemary's pale lips.</p>

<p>Edith might have replied that she came up
to avoid meeting anyone, but she only said,
with cool astonishment: "Why, no. Why
should I?"</p>

<p>There was no answer to that. Indeed,
thought Rosemary, floundering helplessly in
a sea of pain, there was no reason. Was she
not in the same house with him, day in and
day out?</p>

<p>"She's married," Rosemary said to herself
with stern insistence, trying to find comfort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
in the thought, but comfort strangely failed
now. Another suspicion assailed her and was
instantly put into headlong speech. "Is
your husband dead, or are you divorced?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Too Late</div>

<p>Mrs. Lee turned quickly. She surveyed the
girl calmly for an instant, entirely unable to
translate her evident confusion; then she rose.</p>

<p>"Neither," she returned, icily, "and if there
are no other personal questions you desire to
ask me, I'll go back."</p>

<p>Rosemary kept back the tears until Mrs.
Lee was out of sight. "She's married," she
sobbed, "and he isn't dead, and they're not
divorced, so why&mdash;oh, why?" The pain
unreasonably persisted, taking to itself a fresh
hold. She had offended Mrs. Lee and she
would tell Alden, and Alden would be displeased
and would never forgive her.</p>

<p>If she were to run after her, and apologise,
assuring her that she had not meant the
slightest offence, perhaps&mdash;. She stumbled to
her feet, but, even as she did so, she knew
that it was too late. She longed with all the
passion of her desolate soul for Alden's arms
around her, for only the touch of his hand or
the sound of his voice, saying: "Rosemary!
Rosemary dear!" But it was too late for that
also&mdash;everything came too late!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>By the time she reached the foot of the hill
Edith had understood and pardoned Rose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>mary.
"Poor child," she thought. "Think
of her loving him, and actually being jealous
of me! And, man-like, of course, he's
never noticed it. For her sake, I hope he
won't."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Like a
Nymph</div>

<p>She waited to gather a spray or two of wild
crab-apple blossoms, then went home. She
did not see Alden, but stopped to exchange a
few words with Madame, then went on up-stairs.
The long walk had wearied her, but
it had also made her more lovely. After an
hour of rest and a cool shower, she was ready
to dress for dinner.</p>

<p>She chose a dinner-gown of white embroidered
chiffon that she had not yet worn. It
was cut away a little at the throat and the
sleeves came to the elbow. She was not in the
mood for jewels, but she clasped a string of
pearls around her perfect throat, and put the
crab-apple blossoms in her hair. The experiment
was rather daring, but wholly successful,
as she took care to have green leaves between
her hair and the blossoms.</p>

<p>When she went down, Madame and Alden
were waiting for her, Alden in evening clothes
as usual and Madame in her lavender gown.</p>

<p>"You look like a nymph of Botticelli's,"
commented Alden, with a smile. There was
no trace of confusion, or even of consciousness
in his manner, and, once again, Edith
reproached herself for her foolishness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">"Don't
Leave Me
Alone"</div>

<p>Dinner was cheerful, though not lively.
Once or twice, Edith caught Alden looking
at her with a strange expression on his face.
Madame chattered on happily, of the vineyard
and the garden and the small household
affairs that occupied her attention.</p>

<p>Afterward, Alden read the paper and the
other two played cribbage. It was only a
little after nine when Madame, concealing a
yawn, announced that she was tired and would
go to bed, if she might be excused.</p>

<p>Edith rose with alacrity. "I'll come, too,"
she said. "It's astonishing how sleepy it
makes one to be outdoors."</p>

<p>"Don't," Madame protested. "We mustn't
leave him entirely alone. You can sleep late
to-morrow morning if you choose."</p>

<p>"Please don't leave me alone, Mrs. Lee,"
pleaded Alden, rather wickedly.</p>

<p>"All right," Edith answered, accepting the
inevitable as gracefully as she might. "Shall
I play solitaire while you read the paper?"</p>

<p>"If you like," he replied.</p>

<p>Madame took her candle and bade them
good-night. As she went up-stairs, Edith said,
with a pout: "I wish I were going to bed
too."</p>

<p>"You can't sleep all the time," he reminded
her. The paper had slipped to the floor.
"Mother tells me that you slept this morning
until half-past nine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Souvenir
of Rural
Lovers</div>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but&mdash;." She bit her lips and the
colour rose to her temples. She hastily
shuffled the cards and began to play solitaire
so rapidly that he wondered whether she knew
what cards she was playing.</p>

<p>"But," he said, "you didn't sleep well last
night. Was that what you were going to
say?"</p>

<p>Edith dropped her cards, and looked him
straight in the face. "I slept perfectly," she
lied. "Didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I slept just as well as you did," he answered.
She thought she detected a shade of double
meaning in his tone.</p>

<p>"I had a long walk to-day," she went on,
"and it made me sleepy. Look," she
continued, going to the mantel where she
had left the book. "See what I found on
top of a hill, in a crevice between an oak and
a log that lay against it. Do you think some
pair of rural lovers left it there?"</p>

<p>"Possibly," he replied. If the sight of the
book he had loaned Rosemary awoke any
emotion, or even a memory, he did not show
it. "Sit down," he suggested, imperturbably,
"and let me see if I can't find a sonnet
that fits you. Yes, surely&mdash;here it is.
Listen."</p>

<p>She rested her head upon her hand and
turned her face away from him. In his
smooth, well-modulated voice, he read:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Her heart beat wildly and her colour came
and went, but, with difficulty, she controlled
herself until he reached the end. When she
rose, he rose also, dropping the book.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lee&mdash;Edith!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, with a supreme effort at
self-command, "it is a pretty name, isn't it?"
She was very pale, but she offered him her
hand. "I really must go now," she continued,
"for I am tired. Thank you&mdash;and
good-night."</p>

<p>Alden did not answer&mdash;in words. He took
the hand she offered him, held it firmly in his
own, stooped, and kissed the hollow of her
elbow, just below the sleeve.</p>

<p>"She's married, and he isn't dead, and
they're not divorced. She's married
and he isn't dead, and they're not divorced."
Rosemary kept saying it to herself mechanically,
but no comfort came. Through the
long night, wakeful and wretched, she brooded
over the painful difference between the
woman to whom Alden had plighted his troth
and the beautiful stranger whom he saw every
day.</p>

<p>"She's married," Rosemary whispered,
to the coarse unbleached muslin of her pillow.
"And when we're married&mdash;" ah, it would
all be different then. But would it? In a
flash she perceived that marriage itself guarantees
nothing in the way of love.</p>

<p>Hurt to her heart's core, Rosemary sat up
in bed and pondered, while the tears streamed
over her cheeks. She had not seen Alden
since Mrs. Lee came, except the day she had
gone there to tea, wearing her white muslin
under her brown alpaca. There was no way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
to see him, unless she went there again&mdash;the
very thought of that made her shudder&mdash;or
signalled from her hill-top with the scarlet
ribbon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hugging
her Grief</div>

<p>And, to her, the Hill of the Muses was like
some holy place that had been profaned. The
dainty feet of the stranger had set themselves
upon her path in more ways than one. What
must life be out in the world, when the world
was full of women like Mrs. Lee, perhaps even
more beautiful? Was everyone, married or
not, continually stabbed by some heart-breaking
difference between herself and another?</p>

<p>Having the gift of detachment immeasurably
beyond woman, man may separate himself
from his grief, contemplate it calmly in
its various phases, and, with a mighty effort,
throw it aside. Woman, on the contrary,
hugs hers close to her aching breast and remorselessly
turns the knife in her wound.
It is she who keeps anniversaries, walks in
cemeteries, wears mourning, and preserves
trifles that sorrowfully have outlasted the
love that gave them.</p>

<p>If she could only see him once! And yet,
what was there to say or what was there to
do, beyond sobbing out her desolate heart in
the shelter of his arms? Could she tell him
that she was miserable because she had come
face to face with a woman more beautiful
than she; that she doubted his loyalty, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
devotion? From some far off ancestor, her
woman's dower of pride and silence suddenly
asserted itself in Rosemary. When he wanted
her, he would find her. If he missed her
signal, fluttering from the birch tree in the
Spring wind, he could write and say so.
Meanwhile she would not seek him, though
her heart should break from loneliness and
despair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worn and
Weary</div>

<p>Craving the dear touch of him, the sound
of his voice, or even the sight of his tall well-knit
figure moving along swiftly in the dusk,
she compelled herself to accept the situation,
bitterness and all. Across her open window
struck the single long deepening shadow that
precedes daybreak, then grey lights dawned
on the far horizon, paling the stars to points
of pearl upon dim purple mists. Worn and
weary, Rosemary slept until she was called
to begin the day's dreary round of toil, as
mechanical as the ticking of a clock.</p>

<p>Cold water removed the traces of tears from
her cheeks, but her eyes were red and swollen.
The cheap mirror exaggerated her plainness,
while memory pitilessly emphasised the beauty
of the other woman. As she dressed, the
thought came to her that, no matter what
happened, she could still go on loving him,
that she might always give, whether or not
she received anything at all in return.</p>

<p>"Service," she said to herself, remembering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
her dream, "and sacrifice. Giving, not receiving;
asking, not answer." If this indeed
was love, she had it in fullest measure, so
why should she ask for more?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Waiting
for
Breakfast</div>

<p>"Rosemary!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she called back, trying hard to make
her voice even, "I'm coming!"</p>

<p>"It beats all," Grandmother said, fretfully,
when she rushed breathlessly into the dining-room.
"For the life of me I can't understand
how you can sleep so much."</p>

<p>Rosemary smiled grimly, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Here I've been settin', waitin' for my
breakfast, since before six, and it's almost
seven now."</p>

<p>"Never mind," the girl returned, kindly;
"I'll get it ready just as quickly as I can."</p>

<p>"I was just sayin'," Grandmother continued
when Aunt Matilda came into the room,
"that it beats all how Rosemary can sleep.
I've been up since half-past five and she's
just beginnin' to get breakfast, and here you
come, trailin' along in with your hair not
combed, at ten minutes to breakfast time. I
should think you'd be ashamed."</p>

<p>"My hair is combed," Matilda retorted,
quickly on the defensive.</p>

<p>"I don't know when it was," Grandmother
fretted. "I ain't seen it combed since I can
remember."</p>

<p>"Then it's because you ain't looked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Any time you want to see me combin' my
hair you can come in. I do it every morning."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fluffy
Hair</div>

<p>Grandmother laughed, sarcastically. "'Pears
like you thought you was one of them mermaids
I was readin' about in the paper once.
They're half fish and half woman and they
set on rocks, combin' their hair and singin' and
the ships go to pieces on the rocks 'cause the
sailors are so anxious to see 'em they forget
where they're goin'."</p>

<p>"There ain't no rocks outside my door as
I know of," Matilda returned, "and only one
rocker inside."</p>

<p>"No, nor your hair ain't like theirs neither.
The paper said their hair was golden."</p>

<p>"Must be nice and stiff," Matilda commented.
"I'd hate to have my hair all wire."</p>

<p>Grandmother lifted her spectacles from the
wart and peered through them critically. "I
dunno," she said, "as it'd look any different,
except for the colour. The way you're
settin' now, against the light, I can see bristles
stickin' out all over it, same as if 'twas wire."</p>

<p>"Fluffy hair is all the style now," said
Matilda, complacently.</p>

<p>"Fluffy!" Grandmother grunted. "If that's
what you call it, I reckon it'll soon go
out. It might have been out for fifteen or
twenty years and you not know it. I don't
believe any self-respectin' woman would let
her hair go like that. Why 'n the name of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
common sense can't you take a hair brush and
wet it in cold water and slick it up, so's folks
can see that it's combed? Mine's always
slick, and nobody can't say that it isn't."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grandmother's
Disappointment</div>

<p>"Yes," Matilda agreed with a scornful
glance, "it is slick, what there is of it."</p>

<p>Grandmother's head burned pink through
her scanty white locks and her eyes flashed
dangerously. Somewhat frightened, Matilda
hastened to change the subject.</p>

<p>"She wears her hair like mine."</p>

<p>"She?" repeated Grandmother, pricking up
her ears, "Who's she?"</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;the company up to Marshs'."</p>

<p>"Who was tellin' you? The milkman, or
his wife?"</p>

<p>"None of 'em," answered Matilda, mysteriously.
Then, lowering her voice to a
whisper, she added: "I seen her myself!"</p>

<p>"When?" Grandmother demanded. "You
been up there, payin' back your own call?"</p>

<p>"She went by here yesterday," said Matilda,
hurriedly.</p>

<p>"What was I doin'?" the old lady inquired,
resentfully.</p>

<p>"One time you was asleep and one time you
was readin'."</p>

<p>"What? Do you mean to tell me she went
by here twice and you ain't never told me
till now?"</p>

<p>"When you've been readin'," Matilda<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
rejoined, with secret delight, "you've always
told me and Rosemary too that you wan't to
be disturbed unless the house took afire. Ain't
she, Rosemary?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">If Anything's
Important</div>

<p>"What?" asked the girl, placing a saucer
of stewed prunes at each place and drawing
up the three chairs.</p>

<p>"Ain't she always said she didn't want to
be disturbed when she was readin'?" She
indicated Grandmother by an inclination of
her frowsy head.</p>

<p>"I don't believe any of us like to be interrupted
when we're reading," Rosemary replied,
tactfully. She disliked to "take sides,"
and always avoided it whenever possible.</p>

<p>"There," exclaimed Matilda, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"And the other time?" pursued Grandmother.
Her eyes glittered and her cheeks
burned with dull, smouldering fires.</p>

<p>"You was asleep."</p>

<p>"I could have been woke up, couldn't
I?"</p>

<p>"You could have been," Matilda replied,
after a moment's thought, "but when you've
been woke up I ain't never liked to be the one
what did it."</p>

<p>"If it's anything important," Grandmother
observed, as she began to eat, "I'm willin'
to be interrupted when I'm readin', or to be
woke up when I'm asleep, and if that woman
ever goes by the house again, I want to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
told of it, and I want you both to understand
it, right here and now."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Have You
Seen Her?</div>

<p>"What woman?" queried Rosemary. She
had been busy in the kitchen and had not
grasped the subject of the conversation,
though the rumbling of it had reached her
from afar.</p>

<p>"Marshs' company," said both voices at
once.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Rosemary steadied herself for a
moment against the back of her chair and
then sat down.</p>

<p>"Have you seen her?" asked Grandmother.</p>

<p>"Yes." Rosemary's answer was scarcely
more than a whisper. In her wretchedness,
she told the truth, being unable to think sufficiently
to lie.</p>

<p>"When?" asked Aunt Matilda.</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded Grandmother.</p>

<p>"Yesterday, when I was out for a walk."
It was not necessary to go back of yesterday.</p>

<p>"Where was she?" insisted Grandmother.</p>

<p>"Up on the hill. I didn't know she was
there when I went up. She was at the top,
resting."</p>

<p>"Did she speak to you?" asked Aunt
Matilda.</p>

<p>"Yes." Rosemary's voice was very low
and had in it all the weariness of the world.</p>

<p>"What did she say?" inquired Grandmother,
with the air of the attorney for the defence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
The spectacles were resting upon the wart now,
and she peered over them disconcertingly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What
Does She
Look Like?</div>

<p>"I asked you what she said," Grandmother
repeated distinctly, after a pause.</p>

<p>"She said: 'How do you do, Miss Starr?'"</p>

<p>"How'd she know who you were?"</p>

<p>"There, there, Mother," put in Aunt
Matilda. "I reckon everybody in these parts
knows the Starr family."</p>

<p>"Of course," returned the old lady, somewhat
mollified. "What else did she say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much," stammered Rosemary.
"That is, I can't remember. She said it was
a nice day, or something of that sort, and then
she went back home. She didn't stay but a
minute." So much was true, even though that
minute had agonised Rosemary beyond words.</p>

<p>"What does she look like?" Grandmother
continued, with deep interest.</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;like anybody we know. Aunt Matilda
can tell you better than I can. She saw
her too."</p>

<p>Accepting modestly this tribute to her
powers of observation, Aunt Matilda took the
conversation out of Rosemary's hands, greatly
to her relief. The remainder of breakfast
was a spirited dialogue. Grandmother's doubt
on any one point was quickly silenced by the
sarcastic comment from Matilda: "Well,
bein' as you've seen her and I haven't, of
course you know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Under the
Ban</div>

<p>Meanwhile Rosemary ate, not knowing what
she ate, choking down her food with glass
after glass of water which by no means assuaged
the inner fires. While she was washing
the breakfast dishes the other two were discussing
Mrs. Lee's hair. Grandmother insisted
that it was a wig, as play-actresses
always wore them and Mrs. Lee was undoubtedly
a play-actress.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Matilda inquired,
with sarcastic inflection.</p>

<p>"If she ain't," Grandmother parried,
"what's she gallivantin' around the country
for without her husband?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he's dead."</p>

<p>"If he's dead, why ain't she wearin' mourning,
as any decent woman would? She's
either a play-actress, or else she's a divorced
woman, or maybe both." Either condition,
in Grandmother's mind, was the seal of social
damnation.</p>

<p>"If we was on callin' terms with the
Marshs," said Matilda, meditatively, "Mis'
Marsh might be bringin' her here."</p>

<p>"Not twice," returned Grandmother, with
determination. "This is my house, and I've
got something to say about who comes in it.
I wouldn't even have Mis' Marsh now, after
she's been hobnobbin' with the likes of her."</p>

<p>After reverting for a moment to the copper-coloured
hair, which might or might not be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
wig, the conversation drifted back to mermaids
and the seafaring folk who went astray
on the rocks. Aunt Matilda insisted that
there were no such things as mermaids, and
Grandmother triumphantly dug up the article
in question from a copy of <i>The Household
Guardian</i> more than three months old.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Working
Faithfully</div>

<p>"It's a lie, just the same," Matilda protested,
though weakly, as one in the last ditch.</p>

<p>"Matilda Starr!" The clarion note of
Grandmother's voice would have made the
dead stir. "Ain't I showed it to you, in the
paper?" To question print was as impious as
to doubt Holy Writ.</p>

<p>Rosemary was greatly relieved when Mrs.
Lee gave way to mermaids in the eternal flow
of talk. She wondered, sometimes, that their
voices did not fail them, though occasionally
a sulky silence or a nap produced a brief interval
of peace. She worked faithfully until
her household tasks were accomplished, discovering
that, no matter how one's heart
aches, one can do the necessary things and
do them well.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon, she found herself
free. Instinct and remorseless pain led her
unerringly to the one place, where the great
joy had come to her. She searched her suffering
dumbly, and without mercy. If she knew
the reason why!</p>

<p>"She's married, and her husband isn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
dead, and they're not divorced." Parrot-like,
Rosemary repeated the words to herself,
emphasising each fact with a tap of her foot
on the ground in front of her. Then a new
fear presented itself, clutching coldly at her
heart. Perhaps they were going to be divorced
and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Something
Snapped</div>

<p>Something seemed to snap, like the breaking
of a strained tension. Rosemary had come
to the point where she could endure no more,
and mercifully the pain was eased. Later on,
no doubt, she could suffer again, but for the
moment she felt only a dull weariness. In
the background the ache slumbered, like an
ember that is covered with ashes, but now
she was at rest.</p>

<p>She looked about her curiously, as though
she were a stranger. Yet, at the very spot
where she stood, Mrs. Lee had stood yesterday,
her brown eyes cold with controlled
anger when she made her sarcastic farewell.
When she first saw her, she had been sitting
on the log, where Alden usually sat. Down
in the hollow tree was the wooden box that
held the red ribbon. Shyly, the nine silver
birches, with bowed heads, had turned down
the hillside and stopped. Across, on the other
side of the hill, where God hung His flaming
tapestries of sunset from the high walls of
Heaven, Rosemary had stood that day,
weeping, and Love had come to comfort her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Another
Standard</div>

<p>None of it mattered now&mdash;nothing mattered
any more. She had reached the end, whatever
the end might be. Seemingly it was a
great pause of soul and body, the consciousness
of arrival at the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>When she saw Alden, she would ask to be
released. She could tell him, with some semblance
of truth, that she could not leave
Grandmother and Aunt Matilda, because they
needed her, and after they had done so much
for her, she could not bring herself to seem
ungrateful, even for him. The books were
full of such things&mdash;the eternal sacrifice of
youth to age, which age unblushingly accepts,
perhaps in remembrance of some sacrifice of
its own.</p>

<p>He had told her, long ago, that she was
the only woman he knew. Now he had
another standard to judge her by and, at the
best, she must fall far short of it. Some day
Alden would marry&mdash;he must marry, and have
a home of his own when his mother was no
longer there to make it for him, and she&mdash;she
was not good enough for him, any more than
Cinderella was good enough for the Prince.</p>

<p>The fact that the Prince had considered
Cinderella fully his equal happily escaped
Rosemary now. Clearly before her lay the
one thing to be done: to tell him it was all a
mistake, and ask for freedom before he forced
it upon her. He had been very kind the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
day, when she had gone there to tea but,
naturally, he had seen the difference&mdash;must
have seen it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rosemary's
Few Days
of Joy</div>

<p>Of course it would not be Mrs. Lee&mdash;Rosemary
could laugh at that now. Her jealousy
of an individual had been merely the recognition
of a type, and her emotion the unfailing
tribute inferiority accords superiority.
Married, and her husband not dead, nor
divorced&mdash;manifestly it could not be Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>She longed to set him free, to bid him mate
with a woman worthy of him. Some glorious
woman, Rosemary thought, with abundant
beauty and radiant hair, with a low, deep
voice that vibrated through the room like
some stringed instrument and lingered, in
melodious echoes, like music that has ceased.
She saw her few days of joy as the one perfect
thing she had ever had, the one gift she had
prayed for and received. This much could
never be taken away from her. She had had
it and been blessed by it, and now the time
had come to surrender it. What was she,
that she might hope to keep it?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lo, what am I to Love, the Lord of all<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One little shell upon the murmuring sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One little heart-flame sheltered in his hand&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The moment of shelter became divinely
dear. Already, in her remembrance, she had
placed a shrine to which she might go, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
silence, when things became too hard. She
would have written to Alden, if she had had a
sheet of paper, and an envelope, and a stamp,
but she had not, and dared not face the torrent
of questions she would arouse by asking for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No One
Came</div>

<p>Her face transfigured by a passion of renunciation,
Rosemary reached into the hollow
tree for the wooden box, and, for the last time
unwound the scarlet ribbon. She tied it to
the lowest bough of the birch when the school
bell rang, and went back to wait. Without
emotion, she framed the few words she would
say. "Just tell him it's all a mistake, that
they need me and I mustn't leave them, and
so good-bye. And if he tries to kiss me for
good-bye&mdash;oh, he mustn't, for I couldn't
bear that!"</p>

<p>So Rosemary sat and waited&mdash;until almost
dark, but no one came. Alden had, indeed,
hurried home to have afternoon tea with his
mother and Edith. He had almost forgotten
the oriflamme that sometimes signalled to him
from the top of the hill, and seldom even
glanced that way.</p>

<p>In the gathering dusk, Rosemary took it
down, unemotionally. It seemed only part
of the great denial. She put it back into the
box, and hid it in the tree.</p>

<p>"Service," she said to herself, as she went
home, "and sacrifice. Giving, not receiving;
asking, not answer. And this is love!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>



<h2 class="gap3 chaphead"><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>

<h2 class="chaphead">The Stain of the Rose</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Put
Aside</div>

<p>Alden had put Rosemary aside as though
in a mental pigeon-hole. If vague
thoughts of her came now and then to trouble
him, he showed no sign of it. As weeks and
months had sometimes passed without a
meeting, why should it be different now?
Moreover, he was busy, as she must know,
with the vineyard and school, and a guest.</p>

<p>He had ordered several books on the subject
of vine-culture, and was reading a great deal,
though a close observer might have noted
long intervals in which he took no heed of
the book, but stared dreamily into space.
He saw Edith at the table, and in the evenings,
and occasionally at afternoon tea&mdash;a pleasant
custom which she and Madame never failed
to observe,&mdash;but she seemed to make it a
point not to trespass upon his daylight hours.</p>

<p>The apple blossoms had gone, blown in
fragrant drifts afar upon field and meadow.
The vineyard lay lazily upon its southern
slope, basking in the sun. Sometimes a wan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>dering
wind brought a fresh scent of lusty
leaves or a divine hint of bloom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alden's
Feast</div>

<p>The old-fashioned square piano, long silent,
was open now, and had been put in order.
In the evenings, after dinner, Edith would
play, dreamily, in the dusk or by the light of
one candle. The unshaded light, shining full
upon her face, brought out the delicacy of her
profile and allured stray gleams from the
burnished masses of her hair. In the soft
shadows that fell around her, she sat like
St. Cecilia, unconscious of self, and of the man
who sat far back in a corner of the room, never
taking his eyes from her face.</p>

<p>Wistfulness was in every line of her face
and figure, from the small white-shod foot
that rested upon the pedal to the glorious
hair that shimmered and shone but still held
its tangled lights safely in its silken strands.
The long line from shoulder to wrist, the
smooth, satiny texture of the rounded arm,
bare below the elbow, the delicate hands, so
beautifully cared-for, all seemed eloquent
with yearning.</p>

<p>Alden, from his safe point of observation,
feasted his soul to the full. The ivory whiteness
of her neck shaded imperceptibly into
the creamy lace of her gown. Underneath
her firm, well rounded chin, on the left side,
was a place that was almost a dimple, but
not quite. There was a real dimple in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
chin and another at each corner of her mouth,
where the full scarlet lips drooped a little
from sadness. Star-like, her brown eyes
searched the far shadows and sometimes the
flicker of the candle brought a dancing glint
of gold into their depths. And as always,
like a halo, stray gleams hovered about her
head, bent slightly forward now and full into
the light, throwing into faint relief the short
straight nose, and the full, short upper lip.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edith at
the Piano</div>

<p>Smiling, and wholly unconscious, it was as
though she pleaded with the instrument to
give her back some half-forgotten melody.
Presently the strings answered, shyly at
first, then in full soft chords that sang and
crooned through the dusk. Alden, in his
remote corner, drew a long breath of rapture.
The ineffable sweetness of her pervaded his
house, not alone with the scent of violets, but
with the finer, more subtle fragrance of her
personality.</p>

<p>She wore no jewels, except her wedding
ring&mdash;not even the big, blazing diamond with
which her husband had sealed their betrothal.
She had a string of pearls and a quaint, oriental
necklace set with jade, and sometimes she
wore one or two turquoises, or a great, pale
sapphire set in silver, but that was all. Out
of the world of glitter and sparkle, she had
chosen these few things that suited her, and
was content.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Madame
in the
Moonlight</div>

<p>From another corner came the sound of
slow, deep breathing. Outside the circle of
candlelight, Madame had fallen asleep in her
chair. The full June moon had shadowed
the net curtain upon the polished floor and
laid upon it, in silhouette, an arabesque of oak
leaves. It touched Madame's silvered hair
to almost unearthly beauty as she leaned back
with her eyes closed, and brought a memory
of violets and sun from the gold-tasselled
amethyst that hung on her breast. The small
slender hands lay quietly, one on either arm
of her chair. A white cr&ecirc;pe shawl, heavy
with Chinese embroidery, lay over her shoulders,&mdash;a
gift from Edith. A Summer wind,
like a playful child, stole into the room, lifted
the deep silk fringe of the shawl, made merry
with it for a moment, then tinkled the prisms
on the chandelier and ran away again.</p>

<p>The fairy-like sound of it, as though it were
a far, sweet bell, chimed in with Edith's
dreamy chords and brought her to herself
with a start. She turned quickly, saw that
Madame was asleep, and stopped playing.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Alden, in a low tone. "Please
do."</p>

<p>"I mustn't," she whispered, with her
finger on her lips. "Your mother is asleep
and I don't want to disturb her."</p>

<p>"Evidently you haven't," he laughed.</p>

<p>"Hush!" Edith's full, deep contralto took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
on an affected sternness. "You mustn't
talk."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edith's
Room</div>

<p>"But I've got to," he returned. "Shall
we go outdoors?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like."</p>

<p>"Don't you want a wrap of some sort?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Wait a moment, and I'll get it."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;tell me where it is, and I'll go."</p>

<p>"It's only a white chiffon scarf," she said.
"I think you'll find it hanging from the back
of that low rocker, near the dressing-table."</p>

<p>He went up-stairs, silently and swiftly, and
paused, for a moment, at Edith's door. It
seemed strange to have her permission to
turn the knob and go in. He hesitated upon
the threshold, then entered the sweet darkness
which, to him, would have meant Edith,
had it been blown to him across the wastes of
Sahara.</p>

<p>How still it was! Only the cheery piping
of a cricket broke the exquisite peace of the
room; only a patch of moonlight, upon the
polished floor, illumined the scented dusk.
He struck a match, and lighted one of the
candles upon the dressing-table.</p>

<p>The place was eloquent of her, as though she
had just gone out. The carved ivory toilet
articles&mdash;he could have guessed that she
would not have silver ones,&mdash;the crystal puff
box, with a gold top ornamented only by a
monogram; no, it was not a monogram either,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
but interlaced initials trailing diagonally
across it; the mirror, a carelessly crumpled
handkerchief, and a gold thimble&mdash;he picked
up each article with a delightful sense of
intimacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Man's
Face</div>

<p>Face down upon the dressing-table was a
photograph, framed in dull green leather.
That, too, he took up without stopping to
question the propriety of it. A man's face
smiled back at him, a young, happy face, full
of comradeship and the joy of life for its own
sake.</p>

<p>This, then, was her husband! Alden's
heart grew hot with resentment at the man
who had made Edith miserable. He had put
those sad lines under her eyes, that showed so
plainly sometimes when she was tired, made
her sweet mouth droop at the corners, and
filled her whole personality with the wistfulness
that struck at his heart, like the wistfulness
of a little child.</p>

<p>This man, with the jovial countenance, and
doubtless genial ways, had the right to stand
at her dressing-table, if he chose, and speculate
upon the various uses of all the daintiness that
was spread before him. He had the right and
cared nothing for it, while the man who did
care, stood there shamefaced, all at once feeling
himself an intruder in a sacred place.</p>

<p>He put the photograph back, face down,
as it had been, took the scarf, put out the light,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
and went back down-stairs. He stopped for
a moment in the hall to wonder what this was
that assailed him so strangely, this passionate
bitterness against the other man, this longing
to shelter Edith from whatever might make
her unhappy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the
Veranda</div>

<p>The living-room was dark. In her moonlit
corner, Madame still slept. From where he
stood, he could see the dainty little lavender-clad
figure enwrapped in its white shawl.
There was no sign of Edith in the room, so
he went out upon the veranda, guessing that
he should find her there.</p>

<p>She had taken out two chairs&mdash;a favourite
rocker of her own, and the straight-backed,
deep chair in which Alden usually sat when
he was reading. The chairs faced each other,
with a little distance between them. Edith
sat in hers, rocking, with her hands crossed
behind her head, and her little white feet
stretched out in front of her.</p>

<p>Without speaking, Alden went back for a
footstool. Then he turned Edith, chair and
all, toward the moonlight, slipped the footstool
under her feet, laid the fluttering length of
chiffon over her shoulders, and brought his
own chair farther forward.</p>

<p>"Why," she laughed, as he sat down,
"do you presume to change my arrangements?"</p>

<p>"Because I want to see your face."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
Moonlight</div>

<p>"Didn't it occur to you that I might want
to see yours?"</p>

<p>"Not especially."</p>

<p>"My son," she said, in her most matronly
manner, "kindly remember that a woman
past her first youth always prefers to sit with
her back toward the light."</p>

<p>"I'm older than you are," he reminded
her, "so don't be patronising."</p>

<p>"In years only," she returned. "In worldly
wisdom and experience and all the things that
count, I'm almost as old as your mother is.
Sometimes," she added, bitterly, "I feel as
though I were a thousand."</p>

<p>A shadow crossed his face, but, as his figure
loomed darkly against the moon, Edith did
not see it. The caressing glamour of the
light revealed the sad sweetness of her mouth,
but presently her lips curved upward in a
forced smile.</p>

<p>"Why is it?" she asked, "that moonlight
makes one think?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know it did," he replied. "I
thought it was supposed to have quite the
opposite effect."</p>

<p>"It doesn't with me. In the sun, I'm
sane, and have control of myself, but nights
like this drive me almost mad sometimes."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked gently, leaning toward
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," she sighed. "There's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
so much I might have that I haven't."
Then she added, suddenly: "What did you
think of my husband's picture?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edith's
Husband</div>

<p>The end of the chiffon scarf rose to meet a
passing breeze, then fell back against the
softness of her arm. A great grey-winged
night moth fluttered past them. From the
high bough of a distant maple came the
frightened twitter of little birds, wakeful in
the night, and the soft, murmurous voice of
the brooding mother, soothing them.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" asked Alden, slowly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I just knew. You were looking at
my dressing-table first, and you picked up
the picture without thinking. Then, as soon
as you knew who it was, you put it down,
found the scarf, and came out."</p>

<p>"Do you love him?"</p>

<p>"No. That is, I don't think I do. But&mdash;oh,"
she added, with a sharp indrawing of her
breath, "how I did love him!"</p>

<p>"And he&mdash;" Alden went on. "Does he
love you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so, in his way. As much as he
is capable of caring for anything except himself,
he cares for me."</p>

<p>She rose and walked restlessly along the
veranda, the man following her with his eyes,
until she reached the latticed end, where a
climbing crimson rose, in full bloom, breathed
the fragrance of some far Persian garden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Reaching up, she picked one, on a long,
slender stem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Crimson
Rose</div>

<p>Alden appeared beside her, with his knife in
his hand. "Shall I take off the thorns for
you?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm used to thorns. Besides, the
wise ones are those who accept things as they
are." She thrust the stem into her belt, found
a pin from somewhere, and pinned the flower
itself upon the creamy lace of her gown.</p>

<p>"It's just over your heart," he said. "Is
your heart a rose too?"</p>

<p>"As far as thorns go, yes."</p>

<p>She leaned back against one of the white
columns of the porch. She was facing the
moonlight, but the lattice and the rose shaded
her with fragrant dusk.</p>

<p>"Father and Mother planted this rose,"
Alden said, "the day they were married."</p>

<p>"How lovely," she answered, without
emotion. "But to think that the rose has
outlived one and probably will outlive the
other!"</p>

<p>"Mother says she hopes it will. She wants
to leave it here for me and my problematical
children. The tribal sense runs rampant in
Mother."</p>

<p>"When are you and Miss Starr going to be
married?" asked Edith, idly.</p>

<p>Alden started. "How did you know?" he
demanded, roughly, possessing himself of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
hands. "Who told you&mdash;Mother, or&mdash;Miss
Starr?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mutual
Understanding</div>

<p>"Neither," replied Edith, coldly, releasing
herself. "I&mdash;just knew. I beg your pardon,"
she added, hastily. "Of course it's none of
my affair."</p>

<p>"But it is," he said, under his breath.
Then, coming closer, he took her hands again.
"Look here, Edith, there's something between
you and me&mdash;do you know it?"</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" She tried to speak
lightly, but her face was pale.</p>

<p>"You know very well what I mean. How
do you know what I think, what I do, what I
am? And the nights&mdash;no, don't try to get
away from me&mdash;from that first night when I
woke at four and knew you were crying, to
that other night when you knew it was I who
was awake with you, and all the nights since
when the tide of time has turned between
three and four! I've known your thoughts,
your hopes, your dreams, as you've known
mine!</p>

<p>"And the next day," he went on, "when
you avoid me even with your eyes; when you
try to hide with laughter and light words your
consciousness of the fact that the night before
you and I have met somewhere, in some mysterious
way, and known each other as though
we were face to face! Can you be miserable,
and I not know it? Can I be tormented by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
a thousand doubts, and you not know it?
Could you be ill, or troubled, or even perplexed,
and I not know, though the whole
world lay between us? Answer me!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oblivious
of Time
and Space</div>

<p>Edith's face was very white and her lips
almost refused to move. "Oh, Boy," she
whispered, brokenly. "What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"This," he answered, imperiously. "It
means this&mdash;and now!"</p>

<p>He took her into his arms, crushing her to
him so tightly that she almost cried out with
the delicious pain of it. In the rose-scented
shadow, his mouth found hers.</p>

<p>Time and space were no more. At the portal
of the lips, soul met soul. The shaded
veranda, and even the house itself faded
away. Only this new-born ecstasy lived, like
a flaming star suddenly come to earth.</p>

<p>Madame stirred in her sleep. Then she
called, drowsily: "Alden! Edith!" No one
answered, because no one heard. She got up,
smothering a yawn behind her hand, wondered
that there were no lights, waited a moment,
heard nothing, and came to the window.</p>

<p>The moon flooded the earth with enchantment&mdash;a
silvery ocean of light breaking upon
earth-bound shores. A path of it lay along
the veranda&mdash;opal and tourmaline and pearl,
sharply turned aside by the shadow of the
rose.</p>

<p>Madame drew her breath quickly. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
they stood, partly in the dusk and partly in
the light, close in each other's arms, with
the misty silver lying lovingly upon Edith's
hair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pledges of
Love</div>

<p>She sank back into a chair, remembering,
with vague terror, the vision she had seen in the
crystal ball. So, then, it was true, as she
might have known. Sorely troubled, and
with her heart aching for them both, she crept
up-stairs.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Boy," whispered Edith, shrinking from
him. "Oh, Boy! The whole world lies between
you and me!"</p>

<p>His only answer was to hold her closer still,
to turn her mouth again to his. "Not to-night,"
he breathed, with his lips on hers.
"God has given us to-night!"</p>

<p>White and shaken, but with her eyes shining
like stars, at last she broke away from him.
She turned toward the house, but he caught
her and held her back.</p>

<p>"Say it,"he pleaded. "Say you love me!"</p>

<p>"I do," she whispered. "Oh, have pity,
and let me go!"</p>

<p>"And I," he answered, with his face illumined,
"love you with all my heart and
soul and strength and will&mdash;with every fibre
of my being, for now and for ever. I am yours
absolutely, while earth holds me, and even
beyond that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">What
Matters</div>

<p>Edith looked up quickly, half afraid. His
eyes were glowing with strange, sweet fires.</p>

<p>"Say it!" he commanded. "Tell me you
are mine!"</p>

<p>"I am," she breathed. "God knows I am,
but no&mdash;I had forgotten for the moment!"</p>

<p>She broke into wild sobbing, and he put
his arm around her with infinite tenderness.
"Hush," he said, as one might speak to a
child. "What has been does not matter&mdash;nothing
matters now but this. In all the
ways of Heaven, you are mine&mdash;mine for
always, by divine right!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, simply, and lifted her
tear-stained face to his.</p>

<p>He kissed her again, not with passion, but
with that same indescribable tenderness.
Neither said a word. They went into the
house together, he found her candle, lighted it,
and gave it to her.</p>

<p>She took it from him, smiling, though her
hands trembled. Back in the shadow he
watched her as she ascended, with a look of
exaltation upon her face. Crimson petals
were falling all around her, and he saw the
stain of the rose upon her white gown, where
he had crushed it against her heart.</p>

<p>Neither slept, until the tide of the night
began to turn. Swiftly, to her, through the
throbbing, living darkness, came a question
and a call.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Peace</div>

<p>"Mine?"</p>

<p>Back surged the unmistakable answer:
"Thine." Then, to both, came dreamless
peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Madame
Reproaches
Herself</div>

<p>Edith did not appear at breakfast. Alden
seemed preoccupied, ate but little,
and Madame, pale after a sleepless night,
ate nothing at all. Furtively she watched
her son, longing to share his thoughts and
warn him against the trouble that inevitably
lay ahead.</p>

<p>Woman-like, she blamed the woman, even
including herself. She knew that what she
had seen last night was not the evidence of a
mere flirtation or passing fancy, and reproached
herself bitterly because she had
asked Edith to stay.</p>

<p>And yet, what mother could hope to shield
her son against temptation in its most intoxicating
form? For his thirty years he had lived
in the valley, practically without feminine
society. Only his mother, and, of late, Rosemary.
Then, star-like upon his desert, Edith
had arisen, young, beautiful, unhappy, with
all the arts and graces a highly specialised
civilisation bestows upon its women.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Looking
Back</div>

<p>Madame's heart softened a little toward
Edith. Perhaps she was not wholly to blame.
She remembered the night Edith had endeavoured
to escape a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Alden
and she herself had practically forced her to
stay. Regardless of the warning given by
the crystal ball, in which Madame now had
more faith than ever, she had not only given
opportunity, but had even forced it upon
them.</p>

<p>Looking back, she could not remember,
upon Edith's part, a word or even a look that
had been out of place. She could recall no
instance in which she had shown the slightest
desire for Alden's society. Where another
woman might have put herself in his way,
times without number, Edith had kept to her
own room, or had gone out alone.</p>

<p>On the contrary, Madame herself had
urged drives and walks. Frequently she
had asked Alden to do certain things and had
reminded him of the courtesy due from host
to guest. Once, when she had requested him
to take Edith out for a drive, he had replied,
somewhat sharply, that he had already invited
her and she had refused to go.</p>

<p>Murmuring an excuse, Alden left the table
and went out. Madame was rather glad to
be left alone, for she wanted time to think,
not as one thinks in darkness, when one painful
subject, thrown out of perspective, assumes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
exaggerated proportions of importance, but
in clear, sane sunlight, surrounded by the
reassuring evidences of every-day living.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Madame's
View of
the Case</div>

<p>Obviously she could not speak to either.
She could not say to Alden: "I saw you
last night with Edith in your arms and that
sort of thing will not do." Nor could she say
to Edith: "My dear, you must remember
that you are a married woman." She must
not only wait for confidences, but must keep
from them both, for ever, the fact that she
had accidentally stumbled upon their divine
moment.</p>

<p>After long thought, and eager to be just,
she held Edith practically blameless, yet, none
the less, earnestly wished that she would go
home. She smiled whimsically, wishing that
there were a social formula in which, without
offence, one might request an invited guest
to depart. She wondered that one's home
must be continually open, when other places
are permitted to close. The graceful social
lie, "Not at home," had never appealed to
Madame. Why might not one say, truthfully:
"I am sorry you want to see me, for I
haven't the slightest desire in the world to
see you. Please go away." Or, to an invited
guest: "When I asked you to come I wanted
to see you, but I have seen quite enough of
you for the present, and would be glad to
have you go home."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Wearisome
Day</div>

<p>Her reflections were cut short by the
appearance of Edith herself, wan and weary,
very pale, but none the less transfigured by
secret joy. Her eyes, alight with mysterious
fires, held in their starry depths a world of
love and pain. In some occult way she suggested
to Madame a light burning before a
shrine.</p>

<p>Edith did not care for breakfast but forced
herself to eat a little. She responded to
Madame's polite inquiries in monosyllables,
and her voice was faint and far away. Yes,
she was well. No, she had not slept until
almost morning. No, nothing was making
her unhappy&mdash;that was, nothing new. After
all, perhaps she did have a headache. Yes,
she believed she would lie down. It was very
kind of Madame but she did not believe she
wanted any luncheon and certainly would not
trouble anyone to bring it up.</p>

<p>Yet at noon, when Madame herself appeared
with a tempting tray, Edith gratefully accepted
a cup of coffee. She was not lying
down, but was sitting in her low rocker, with
her hands clasped behind her head and the
photograph of her husband on the dressing-table
before her.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, in answer to Madame's
inquiring glance, "that's my husband. It
was taken just about the time we were
married."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">On the
Stroke of
Seven</div>

<p>Madame took the picture, studied it for a
moment, then returned it to its place. She
made no comment, having been asked for
none.</p>

<p>"Won't you lie down, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe I will."</p>

<p>"Truly?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I promise."</p>

<p>With a sad little smile she kissed Madame,
closed the door, and turned the key in the lock.
The old lady sighed as she went down with
the tray, reflecting how impossible it is really
to aid another, unless the barrier of silence
be removed.</p>

<p>At four, she had her tea alone. No sound
came from up-stairs, and Alden neither returned
to luncheon nor sent word. When he
came in, a little past six, he was tired and
muddy, his face was strained and white, and,
vouchsafing only the briefest answers to his
mother's solicitude, went straight to his room.</p>

<p>Exactly upon the stroke of seven, both
appeared, Alden in evening clothes as usual,
and Edith in her black gown, above which
her face was deathly white by contrast, in
spite of the spangles. She wore no ornaments,
not even the string of pearls about her bare
throat.</p>

<p>"You look as though you were in mourning,
my dear," said Madame. "Let me get you
a red rose."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Things to
Be Said</div>

<p>She started toward the veranda, but, with
a little cry, Edith caught her and held her
back. "No," she said, in a strange tone,
"roses are&mdash;not for me!"</p>

<p>The dinner-gong chimed in with the answer,
and the three went out together. Neither
Alden nor Edith made more than a pretence
of eating. Edith held her head high and
avoided even his eyes, though more than once
Madame saw the intensity of his appeal.</p>

<p>Afterward he took his paper, Madame her
fancy work, and Edith, attempting to play solitaire,
hopelessly fumbled her cards. Madame
made a valiant effort to carry on a conversation
alone, but at length the monologue
wearied her, and she slipped quietly out of
the room.</p>

<p>Edith turned, with a start, and hurriedly
rose to follow her. Alden intercepted her.
"No," he said, quietly. "There are things
to be said between you and me."</p>

<p>"I thought," Edith murmured, as she sank
into the chair he offered her, "that everything
was said last night."</p>

<p>"Everything? Perhaps, but not for the
last time."</p>

<p>She leaned forward, into the light, put her
elbows upon the table, and rested her head
upon her clasped hands, as though to shade
her eyes. "Well?" she said, wearily.</p>

<p>"Look at me!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Vows and
the Law</div>

<p>Her hands trembled, but she did not move.
He leaned across the table, unclasped her
hands gently, and forced her to look at
him. Her eyes were swimming with unshed
tears.</p>

<p>"Darling! My darling! Have I made you
unhappy?"</p>

<p>"No," she faltered. "How could you?"</p>

<p>He came to her, sat down on the arm of her
chair, slipped his arm around her, and held
her close against his shoulder. "Listen,"
he said. "You belong to me, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"Could you&mdash;could you&mdash;make yourself
free?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as you mean it, I could."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;when?"</p>

<p>"Never!" The word rang clear, tensely
vibrant with denial.</p>

<p>"Edith! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Releasing herself she stood and faced him.
"This," she said. "At the altar I pledged
myself in these words: 'Until death do us
part,' and 'Forsaking all others, keep thee only
unto me so long as we both shall live.' Isn't
that plain?"</p>

<p>"The law," he began.</p>

<p>"Law!" repeated Edith. "Why don't you
say perjury, and be done with it?"</p>

<p>"Dearest, you don't understand. You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what I said," she reminded him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
grimly. "I said 'For better or worse,' not 'for
better' only."</p>

<div class="sidenote">What of
Miss
Starr?</div>

<p>"You promised to love and to honour also,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>Edith bowed her head. "I did," she
answered, in a low tone, "and I have, and,
God helping me, I shall do so again."</p>

<p>"Have I no rights?" he asked, with a sigh.</p>

<p>He could scarcely hear the murmured
answer: "None."</p>

<p>"Nor you?"</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly, avoiding his eyes,
then suddenly turned and faced him. "What
of your own honour?" she demanded. "What
of Miss Starr?"</p>

<p>"I have thought of that," he replied,
miserably. "I have thought of nothing else
all day."</p>

<p>Edith leaned back against the table.
"What," she asked, curiously, "were you
planning to do?"</p>

<p>The dull colour rose to his temples. "Go
to her," he said, with his face averted, "tell
her the truth like a man, and ask for freedom."</p>

<p>She laughed&mdash;the sort of laugh one hears
from a woman tossing in delirium. Madame
heard it, up-stairs, and shuddered.</p>

<p>"Like a man!" Edith repeated, scornfully.</p>

<p>"Say it," he said, roughly. "Like a cad,
if that's what you mean."</p>

<p>She laughed again, but with a different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
cadence. "Ask yourself first," she continued,
"and then be honest with me. How would
you feel?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suppose
There Is
Another
Woman</div>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders uneasily. "I
admit it, but I'm willing to pay the price.
I'll feel like a cad all the rest of my life, if I
must, in order to have you."</p>

<p>"If a man has no self-respect," she retorted,
"what can he expect from his&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wife," breathed Alden, in a rapturous
whisper. "Oh, Edith, say you will!"</p>

<p>She turned away, for she could not force
herself to meet his eyes. Her little white
hands clasped the edge of the table tightly.</p>

<p>"Have you thought of this?" he continued.
"Suppose, for him, there is another
woman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There isn't," she denied. "I know that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not in the sense you mean, but
if he were free&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Edith drew a long breath. "I never
thought of that."</p>

<p>Steadily the man pursued his advantage.
"There must be some reason for his treating
you as he does&mdash;for making you miserable. If,
for any cause whatever, he wanted his freedom,
would it make&mdash;any difference to you?"</p>

<p>She tapped her foot restlessly upon the
floor. The atmosphere was surcharged with
expectancy, then grew tense with waiting.
Alden's eyes never swerved from her face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">What
Right?</div>

<p>"Have you any right, through principles
of your own, which I thoroughly understand
and respect, to keep a man bound who desires
to be free?"</p>

<p>She swayed back and forth unsteadily.
Alden assisted her to her chair and stood before
her as she sat with her elbows upon her knees,
her face hidden in her hands. With the precise
observation one accords to trifles in
moments of unendurable stress, he noted that
two of the hooks which fastened her gown at
the back of her neck had become unfastened
and that the white flesh showed through the
opening.</p>

<p>"If," said Alden, mercilessly, "he longs
for his freedom, and the law permits him to
take it, have you the right to force your principles
upon him&mdash;and thus keep him miserable
when he might otherwise be happy?"</p>

<p>The clock in the hall struck ten. The sound
died into silence and the remorseless tick-tick
went on. Outside a belated cricket fiddled
bravely as he fared upon his way. The late
moon flooded the room with light.</p>

<p>"Have you?" demanded Alden. He endeavoured
to speak calmly, but his voice shook.
"Answer me!"</p>

<p>Edith leaned back in her chair, white and
troubled. "I don't know," she murmured,
with lips that scarcely moved. "Before God,
I don't know!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Advantages
of a
Letter</div>

<p>The man went on pitilessly. "Don't you
think you might find out? Before you condemn
yourself and me to everlasting separation,
don't you think you might at least ask
him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Edith, slowly. "I might ask
him. I'll go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you needn't go. Can't you write?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she returned. "I can write."</p>

<p>All the emotion had gone from her voice.
She said the words as meaninglessly as a
parrot might.</p>

<p>"A letter has distinct advantages," remarked
Alden, trying to speak lightly. "You can
say all you want to say before the other person
has a chance to put in a word."</p>

<p>"Yes," she agreed, in the same meaningless
tone. "That is true."</p>

<p>"When," queried Alden, after a pause,
"will you write?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>He nodded his satisfaction. "Tell him,"
he suggested, "that you love another man,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," she interrupted, "I won't tell him
that. I'll say that I've tried my best to be
a good wife, that I've tried as best I knew to
make him happy. I'll say I've&mdash;" she
choked on the word&mdash;"I'll say I've failed.
I'll tell him I can do no more, that I do not
believe I can ever do any better than I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
done, and ask him to tell me frankly whether
or not he prefers to be free. That's all."</p>

<div class="sidenote">How
Different?</div>

<p>"That isn't enough. You have rights&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We're not speaking of my rights," she
said, coldly. "We're speaking of his."</p>

<p>A silence fell between them, tense and
awkward. The open gate between them had
turned gently upon its hinges, then closed,
with a suggestion of finality. The clock
struck the half hour. Outside, the cricket
still chirped cheerily, regardless of the great
issues of life and love.</p>

<p>"Come outside," Alden pleaded, taking her
hand in his.</p>

<p>"No," she said, but she did not withdraw
her hand.</p>

<p>"Come, dear&mdash;come!"</p>

<p>He led her out upon the veranda where the
moon made far-reaching shadows with the
lattice and the climbing rose, then returned
for chairs, the same two in which they had
sat the night before. She was the first to
break the pause.</p>

<p>"How different it all is!" she sighed. "Last
night we sat here in the moonlight, just where
we are now. In twenty-four hours, everything
has changed."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The face of all the world is changed, I think,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he quoted softly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">When
They
Knew</div>

<p>"When did you&mdash;know?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The night I read Rossetti to you and
kissed your arm, do you remember? It
rushed upon me like an overwhelming flood.
When did you know?"</p>

<p>"I think I've always known&mdash;not the fact,
exactly, but the possibility of it. The first
night I came, I knew that you and I could
care a great deal for each other&mdash;not that we
ever would, but merely that we might, under
different circumstances. In a way, it was
as though a set of familiar conditions might
be seen in a different aspect, or in a different
light."</p>

<p>"From the first," he said, "you've meant
a great deal to me, in every way. I was discontented,
moody, restless, and unhappy when
you came. That was mainly responsible
for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hesitated, glanced at her, accepted her
nod of understanding, and went on.</p>

<p>"I've hated the vineyard and the rest of
my work. God only knows how I've hated
it! It's seemed sometimes that I'd die if I
didn't get away from it. Mother and I had
it out one day, and finally I decided to stay,
merely to please her. Because I had nothing
more to do than to make her happy, I determined
to make the best of things. You've
made me feel that, in a way, it's myself that's
at stake. I want to take it and make it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
widely known among vineyards, as it has
been&mdash;for my own sake, and for yours."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Corner
Turned</div>

<p>Edith leaned toward him, full into the
light. Her face, still pale, was rapt&mdash;almost
holy. To him, as to Madame earlier in the
day, she somehow suggested the light before a
shrine. "Thank you," she said. The low,
full contralto tones were vibrant with emotion.</p>

<p>There was a pause. As though a light had
been suddenly thrown upon one groping in
darkness, Alden saw many things. His longing
for Edith, while no less intense, became subtly
different. He seemed to have turned a corner
and found everything changed.</p>

<p>"Dear," he went on, "there's something
wonderful about this. I've&mdash;" he stopped
and cleared his throat. "I mean it's so
exquisitely pure, so transcendently above
passion. Last night, when I had you in my
arms, it wasn't man and woman&mdash;it was soul
and soul. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Passion isn't love&mdash;any
more than hunger is, but an earth-bound
world seldom sees above the fog of sense."</p>

<p>"I could love you always," he returned,
"and never so much as touch your hand or
kiss you again."</p>

<p>She nodded, smiling full comprehension.
Then she asked, briefly: "Why write?"</p>

<p>"Merely because we belong to one another
in a divine sense, and marriage is the earthly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
sanction of it&mdash;or ought to be. If you and I
were both free, and I thought marriage would
in any way change this, I&mdash;I wouldn't ask
you to marry me."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Shadow
Rose</div>

<p>Rising from her chair, she bent over, kissed
him on the forehead, went to the lattice, picked
another rose, and came back. "See," she
said, standing in the light; "life and beauty
and joy&mdash;all in a rose."</p>

<p>"And love," he added.</p>

<p>"And love." She held it at arm's length.
Sharply defined, the shadow fell upon the
white floor of the veranda, perfect in line.</p>

<p>"And there," she continued, "is the same
thing in another form. It is still a rose&mdash;anyone
can see that. Only the colour and
fragrance are gone, but one can remember
both. To-morrow I'll write, and find out
which we're to have&mdash;the rose, or the shadow
of the rose."</p>

<p>"It's chance," he said, "like the tossing of
a coin."</p>

<p>"Most things are," she reminded him.
"Did you ever stop to think what destinies
attend the opening or closing of a door?"</p>

<p>He made no answer. "Good-night," she
said, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Good-night, my beloved." His face was
illumined with "the light that never was on
sea or land," but he did not even attempt
to touch her hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beauty</div>

<p>"'Beauty,'" read Grandmother Starr, with
due emphasis upon every word, "'is the
birthright of every woman,'" She looked up
from the pages of <i>The Household Guardian</i>
as she made this impressive announcement.
Rosemary was busy in the kitchen, and Miss
Matilda sat at the other window mending a
three-cornered tear in last year's brown alpaca.</p>

<p>"'The first necessity of beauty is an erect
carriage,'" she continued.</p>

<p>"That lets us out," commented Matilda,
"not havin' any carriage at all."</p>

<p>"Frank used to say," said Grandmother,
irrelevantly, "that he always had his own
carriage until his Pa and me got tired of
pushin' it."</p>

<p>"What kind of a carriage is an erect carriage?"
queried Matilda, biting off her thread.</p>

<p>"I ain't never heard tell of 'em," replied
Grandmother, cautiously, "but I should think,
from the sound of it, that it was some kind
that was to be driv' standin' up."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Power of
Ages</div>

<p>"Then I've seen 'em."</p>

<p>"Where?" Grandmother lowered her spectacles
to the point where they rested upon the
wart and peered disconcertingly at Matilda.
The upper part of the steel frames crossed her
eyeballs horizontally, giving her an uncanny
appearance.</p>

<p>"At the circus, when Pa took us. After
the whole show was over they had what they
called a chariot race, and women driv' around
the tent in little two-wheeled carts, standin'
up."</p>

<p>"Matilda Starr! 'Tain't no such thing!"</p>

<p>Matilda shrugged her shoulders with an air
of finality. "All right," she returned, with
cold sarcasm, "as long as you see it and I
didn't."</p>

<p>"'Beauty has been the power of the ages,'"
Grandmother continued, taking refuge once
more in <i>The Household Guardian</i>. "'Cleopatra
and Helen of Troy changed the map of the
world by their imperial loveliness.'"</p>

<p>"I didn't know imps was lovely," Matilda
remarked, frowning at the result of her labours.
"I reckon I'll have to set a piece in at the
corner, where it's puckerin'."</p>

<p>"Ain't I always told you that the only
way to mend a three-cornered tear was to set
a piece in? Some folks never get old enough
to learn anything. Even Frank's wife would
have known better'n that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cleopatra</div>

<p>"Never mind Frank's wife," returned Matilda,
somewhat hurriedly. "Let her rest in
her grave and go on readin' about the lovely
imps."</p>

<p>"It doesn't say imps is lovely. It says
'imperial loveliness.'"</p>

<p>"Well, ain't that the same thing?"</p>

<p>"No, it ain't. Imperial means empire."</p>

<p>"Then why ain't it spelled so? Imperial
begins with an <i>i</i> and so does imp, and, accordin'
to what I learned when I went to school,
empire begins with an <i>e</i>."</p>

<p>There seemed to be no adequate reply to
this, so Grandmother went on: "If Cleopatra's
nose had been an inch longer, where would
Egypt have been now?"</p>

<p>"Where 'tis, I reckon," Matilda returned,
seeing that an answer was expected.</p>

<p>"No, it wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't know why not, but if it wouldn't
have made no difference, the man that wrote
the piece wouldn't have asked about it."</p>

<p>"Well, then, let him answer it himself, as
long as he knows."</p>

<p>"'Wars have been fought over beautiful
women,'" Grandmother resumed, "'and will
continue to be till the end of time.'"</p>

<p>"What about Egypt?" interrupted Matilda.</p>

<p>"I ain't come to that yet. Let me alone,
can't you? 'Every mother should begin with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
her child almost from the moment of birth.
Projecting ears can be corrected by the wearing
of a simple cap, and a little daily attention to
the nose in the way of gentle pinching with
the fingers, will insure the proper shape. This
of course, must be done while the cartilage is
easily pushed into the proper position.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Paper's
Circulation</div>

<p>"While the what?" Matilda demanded.</p>

<p>"Cart-i-lage. It means before the child has
outgrown its buggy. 'Teeth and complexion
are to be considered later, but must be looked
after carefully. Every woman should bear in
mind the fact that a good complexion comes
from the inside.'"</p>

<p>"The man what wrote that piece ain't got
the slightest idea of what he's talkin' about."</p>

<p>Grandmother transfixed Matilda with an
icy stare. Then, turning to the last page of
the paper, she read, with due attention to
emphasis: "'<i>The Household Guardian</i> is read
every week in more than one million homes.
Averaging five people to each family, this
means that five million people, every Thursday,
are eagerly watching for the regular issue of
<i>The Household Guardian</i>.' If he don't know
what he's talkin' about, why are five million
people waitin' for the paper? Answer me that,
Matilda Starr, if you can!"</p>

<p>"There ain't five in every family," Matilda
objected. "That means the Pa and Ma and
three children."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Well
Groomed</div>

<p>"Maybe not. Maybe it's the Ma and Pa
and two children and an Aunt or an Uncle or
some other of the family connection."</p>

<p>"Well, even if there's only two children,
if their Ma is makin' 'em caps to hold back
their ears and pinchin' their noses regular,
she ain't got no time to have her own nose
flattened out against the glass lookin' for <i>The
Household Guardian</i>."</p>

<p>"'If, however, through ignorance or the press
of other occupations,'" Grandmother resumed,
clearing her throat, "'this early care has not
been given, every woman, no matter what her
circumstances are, may at least be well-groomed.'"</p>

<p>Matilda giggled hysterically.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" queried Grandmother,
with interest.</p>

<p>"I was just thinkin' about the erect carriage
and the groomin'. The man what wrote that
piece seems to think a woman is a horse.
Reckon I'll get myself a curry-comb."</p>

<p>"It might improve the looks of your hair
some if you did," the old lady observed,
caustically. "'No woman is so poor that she
cannot take the time to attend to her personal
appearance, nor so rich that she can afford to
neglect it. The hair should be shampooed at&mdash;Continued
on page sixty-seven.'"</p>

<p>"The hair should be what?"</p>

<p>"'Shampooed at least once a month.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Face
Massage</div>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt," commanded the old
lady, with the dull red burning on her withered
cheeks. "Here I am readin' to you and
tryin' to improve your mind and all the time
you're interruptin' me."</p>

<p>"Only to ask questions," Matilda returned,
with affected submission. "If I'm to have
my mind improved I want it well done."</p>

<p>"'In the intervals it should be frequently
brushed, and the regular weekly face massage'&mdash;that's
printed wrong&mdash;'the regular weekly
face message should not be neglected.'"</p>

<p>"What's a face message?" asked Matilda,
curiosity overcoming prudence.</p>

<p>"Anything that's said to anybody, I suppose.
Now don't speak to me again. 'The
nails must also be taken care of and one or
two visits to a good manicure will show any
woman how it is to be done. The implements
are not expensive and will last&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"What's a manicure?"</p>

<p>"Some kind of a doctor, I reckon,&mdash;'and will
last a long time. A few simple exercises should
be taken every night and morning to preserve
the fig&mdash;Continued on page seventy.'"</p>

<p>"Preservin' figs ain't any particular exercise,"
Matilda observed, shaking out the
mended skirt. "You can do most of it settin'
down."</p>

<p>"'Preserve the figure,'" Grandmother con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>tinued
with emphasis. "'Soap and hot water
may be used on the face if a good cold cream
is well rubbed into the pores immediately
afterward.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cucumber
Milk</div>

<p>"Vanilla or lemon?" Matilda asked.</p>

<p>"It doesn't say ice-cream, it just says
cold cream. 'Cucumber milk is excellent for
freckles or tan, and&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"I reckon I won't hear no more," said
Matilda. Her lips were compressed into a
thin tight line. "I can stand the carriages
that are to be driv' standin' up, and the
lovely imps and the nose pinchin' and the caps
for the ears, but when it comes to goin' out
every mornin' to milk the cucumbers, I don't
feel called on to set and listen to it. The man
what wrote that piece was as crazy as a loon,
and if five million people read his paper every
week, four million, nine hundred and ninety-nine
thousand and nine hundred and ninety-nine
of 'em know it. I ain't sayin' who's
the one that don't."</p>

<p>She sailed majestically out of the room
with her head held high, and her frowsy grey
hair bristling with indignation. Grandmother's
lower jaw dropped in amazement
for a moment, then she returned to the paper.
"Milkin' the cucumbers don't seem quite
right," she said to herself, "but there it is in
print, as plain as day."</p>

<p>For the first time her faith in the printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
word wavered. "Maybe there's some special
kind of cucumber," she mused, "that gives
milk. We used to hear 'em called cowcumbers.
Why'd they be called that if they didn't
give milk? There's only the two kinds as far
as I know&mdash;the tame and wild, and the wild
ones&mdash;" The light of pure intellectual joy
dawned upon the puzzled old face. "Of
course. Don't I remember the white sticky
juice inside the wild ones? That's it! Wait
till I tell Matilda!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grandmother
Sees the
Stranger</div>

<p>Triumphantly she returned to <i>The Household
Guardian</i>, and, in her new allegiance,
read every line of every advertisement before
folding it carefully and putting it away with
the others. "Good for freckles and tan,"
she said to herself, meditatively, "but it didn't
say nothin' about warts. Maybe that'll be
in next week's paper."</p>

<p>While she sat looking out of the window a
woman passed, walking so slowly that Grandmother
had plenty of time to observe her.
As the stranger turned her head neither to the
right nor the left, the old lady's intense scrutiny
was attended by no embarrassment.</p>

<p>From the fragmentary description that had
come her way, she at once recognised Mrs.
Lee&mdash;the tall, straight figure in a gown of pale
green linen, the dainty, regular features, and
the crown of wonderful hair, radiating sunlit
splendour, as she wore no hat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ready

<p>A letter in her hand betrayed the object of
her passing. "She's goin' to the post-office,"
Grandmother mused, "and if she comes back
this way, I'll see her again. Matilda ain't
seen her but twice and then she had a hat on."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee did, indeed, come back that way,
but gave no sign that she saw, or even felt,
the presence of the keen observer in the window
of the little brown house. Grandmother
hoped that Matilda was not peering from an
upper window. Perhaps she would tell her
immediately, and perhaps she wouldn't.
While she was considering this point, Rosemary
came in, wiping her hands upon her
apron, and announced that she was ready to
go to the store.</p>

<p>Rapidly giving a list of the articles desired,
Grandmother rose from her chair, lifted her
skirts, and from some safe inner pocket, drew
out a black bag, which was evidently fastened
around her waist with a string. This bag
contained another, closely wrapped. Inside
was a much worn leather "wallet," from which
Grandmother extracted a two-dollar bill and
some pennies.</p>

<p>"Run along, Rosemary. I reckon that'll
be enough."</p>

<p>Rosemary obeyed, privately wondering for
the thousandth time whence came Grandmother's
money. Neither she nor Matilda had
ever dared to ask, but when the supply gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
out, the old lady always produced a twenty-dollar
gold piece from the magic bag.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It Seemed
Odd</div>

<p>When she returned from her errand, Aunt
Matilda was nowhere to be seen, and Grandmother,
nodding in her chair by the window,
had not been awakened by the opening and
closing of the door. Rosemary went up-stairs,
and, from sounds that penetrated the hall
through the closed door of Aunt Matilda's
room, inferred that she also was taking an
afternoon nap.</p>

<p>If she could only write to Alden, and tell
him he was free! Night after night she had
pondered over ways and means. It seemed
odd that in a house where there was always
plenty to eat and to wear, of a certain sort,
stationery and stamps should be practically
unknown. Grandmother had used the last
sheet of paper and the last envelope when she
ordered the bolt of brown alpaca, and with
stern suspicion held Rosemary to account for
every penny with which she was entrusted.</p>

<p>If she had paper and an envelope, perhaps
she might ask the storekeeper to send the note
up with the Marshs' groceries, or, better yet,
she might go up to the house herself very early
some morning or very late some night and
slip it under the front door. In that way, she
would be sure he received it. Rosemary
brightened as she saw that a stamp would not
really be necessary after all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rosemary
Takes
Possession
of the Box</div>

<p>If only, among her mother's things in the
attic, there might be an envelope! She could
use brown wrapping paper to write upon,
if worst came to worst&mdash;the storekeeper might
even give her a small, fresh piece of the pale
yellow sort. Rosemary knew every separate
article in the trunk, however, even the inlaid
box to which the key was missing. She had
never dared to ask for the key, much less to
break open the box, but to-day, the courage
of desperation sustained her and she ran
quickly up-stairs.</p>

<p>Long afternoon sunbeams, sweet with June,
came into the attic, and made fairy gold of the
dust as they entered the room. It had none
of the charm which belongs to every well-regulated
attic; it was merely a storehouse, full
of cobwebs and dust. A few old trunks were
stored there, all empty save the small hair-cloth
trunk which held Rosemary's mother's
few possessions that had outlived her.</p>

<p>She opened it, found the box, and discovered
that she had forgotten the scissors
with which she intended to break the lock.
She wondered whether she might safely risk
the trip down-stairs after the scissors, or
whether it would be better to take the box
with her and hide it in her room. Before she
had made up her mind, she heard a slow,
heavy tread upon the stair.</p>

<p>She could not go down and she did not wish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
to be found with the box&mdash;indeed, she dared
not. She cowered back under the eaves and
lay flat on the floor behind the trunk, just as
Grandmother came into the attic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hidden
Gold</div>

<p>For a moment the old lady paused, her keen
eyes searching the room as though she felt a
presence which she did not see. Rosemary lay
very quietly upon the floor, though fearing
that the loud beating of her heart might be
heard in the stillness.</p>

<p>Reassured, and not in the least lame,
Grandmother went to the brick chimney that
came up through the attic, and mounted a
decrepit chair. She scratched and pried at a
certain brick with her scissors, then removed
it quietly. Reaching in, she drew out a
black bag, whence came a sound of tinkling
metal. Rosemary, peering around the corner
of the trunk, could scarcely believe the evidence
of her own senses.</p>

<p>Grandmother took out a twenty-dollar gold
piece, restored the bag to its place, put the
brick back, and went down-stairs with the
quiet, stealthy movement of a cat.</p>

<p>Presently Rosemary went down-stairs also,
with the box, stopping to leave it in her own
room. Cold with excitement, she trembled
when she went into the kitchen and began to
make preparations for supper. She heard
warring voices in the sitting-room, then Grandmother
came to the kitchen door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Old
Photograph</div>

<p>"Oh," she said. "So you came in the back
way. I didn't hear you come in. Reckon I
must have been asleep."</p>

<p>Rosemary did not answer. She longed to
be alone in her own room with the inlaid box,
which now assumed a mystery and portent it
had never had before, but it was almost
midnight before, by the flickering light of
a candle-end, she broke it open, smothering
the slight sound with the patchwork
quilt.</p>

<p>She hoped for stationery, but there was none.
It contained an old photograph and a letter
addressed to Grandmother Starr. Rosemary
leaned to the light with the photograph, studying
it eagerly. It was old and faded, but the
two were still distinct&mdash;a young woman in an
elaborate wedding gown, standing beside a
man who was sitting upon an obviously uncomfortable
chair.</p>

<p>The man, in a way, resembled Grandmother
Starr; the lady looked like Rosemary, except
that she was beautiful. "Father!" cried Rosemary,
in an agonising whisper. "Mother!"
Face to face at last with those of her own
blood, dead though they were!</p>

<p>The little mother was not more than two or
three and twenty: the big strong father was
about twenty-five. She had never been shown
the picture, nor had even guessed its existence.
Since she was old enough to think about it all,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
she had wondered what her father and mother
looked like.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Her
Father's
Letter</div>

<p>Thrilled with a new, mysterious sense of
kinship, she dwelt lovingly upon every line
of the pictured faces, holding the photograph
safely beyond the reach of the swift-falling
tears. She was no longer fatherless, motherless;
alone. Out of the dust of the past, like
some strangely beautiful resurrection, these
two had come to her, richly dowered with
personality.</p>

<p>It was late when she put down the picture
and took up the letter, which was addressed
to Grandmother Starr. She took it out of
the envelope, unfolded the crackling, yellowed
pages, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Dear Mother;</p>

<p>"Since writing to you yesterday that I
was going up north on the <i>Clytie</i>, I have been
thinking about the baby, and that it might be
wise to provide for her as best I can in case
anything should happen to me. So I enclose
a draft for eleven thousand five hundred dollars
made payable to you. I have realised on my
property here, but this is all I have aside from
my passage-money and a little more, and, if
I land safely, I shall probably ask you to return
at least a large part of it.</p>

<p>"But, if the ship should go down, as I sincerely
hope it won't, she will be sure of this,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
for her clothing and education. In case anything
should happen to her, of course I would
want you and Matilda to have the money,
but if it doesn't, give Rosemary everything
she needs or wants while the money lasts,
and oh, mother, be good to my little girl!</p></div>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">"Your loving son,</p>
<p style="margin-left:50%;">"Frank."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Truth of
the
Matter</div>

<p>In a flash of insight Rosemary divined the
truth. The gold hidden behind the loose
brick in the chimney was hers, given to her
by her dead father. And she had not even a
postage stamp!</p>

<p>But swiftly her anger died away in joy&mdash;a
joy that surged and thrilled through her as
some white, heavenly fire that warmed her
inmost soul. Not alone, but cared for&mdash;sheltered,
protected, loved. "Oh," breathed Rosemary,
with her eyes shining; "Father, dear
father&mdash;my father, taking care of me!"
Then, in her thought, she added, without
dreaming of irreverence, "I think God must
be like that!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>



<h2 class="gap3 chaphead"><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI</h2>

<h2 class="chaphead">One Little Hour</h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Two
Faces</div>

<p>When she awoke in the morning it was
with a bewildering sense of change.
Something had happened, and, in the first
moment, she was not quite sure whether a
dream had not boldly overstepped the line
into daylight. The faded photograph, propped
up on the table at the head of her bed, at
once reassured her, and Rosemary smiled,
with a joy so great that it was almost pain
tugging at the fibres of her heart.</p>

<p>To an outsider, perhaps, the two faces would
have been common enough, but one of love's
divinest gifts is the power to bestow beauty
wherever it goes. The old man, bent with
years, with the snows of his fourscore winters
lying heavily upon his head, may seem an
object of kindly pity as he hobbles along with
crutch or cane, going oh, so slowly, where once
his feet were fain to run from very joy of living.
The light may be gone from his faded eyes, his
dull ears may not respond to question or call,
but one face, waiting at a window, shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
illumine at the sight of him, and one voice,
thrilling with tenderness, shall stir him to
eager answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beauty
the Twin
of Love</div>

<p>Or a woman, worn and broken, her rough
hands made shapeless by toil, may seem to
have no claim to beauty as the word is commonly
understood. Sleepless nights, perchance,
have dimmed her eyes, suffering and
sacrifice have seamed and marked her face, but
those to whom she has given herself see only
the great nobleness of her nature, the royalty
of her soul. For the beauty of the spirit may
transfigure its earth-bound temple, as some
vast and grey cathedral with light streaming
from its stained glass windows, and eloquent
with chimes and singing, may breathe incense
and benediction upon every passer-by.</p>

<p>And so, for those to whom love has come,
beauty has come also, but merely as the
reflection in the mirror, since only love may
see and understand the thing itself. Purifying,
uplifting, and exalting, making sense the
humble servant and not the tyrannical master,
renewing itself for ever at divine fountains
that do not fail, inspiring to fresh sacrifice,
urging onward with new courage, redeeming
all mistakes with its infinite pardon; this,
indeed is Love, which neither dies nor grows
old. And, since God himself is Love, what
further assurance do we require of immortality?</p>

<p>Upon the two in the faded picture the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
exquisite mystery of life had wrought its
transfiguration. Vaguely conscious of the unfamiliar
and uncomfortable chair in which he
sat, the young man looked out upon Rosemary,
bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, with
an all-embracing, all-understanding love. It
came to her with a sense of surprise that
father was only a little older than she was;
he had paused, and she, receiving the gift of
life from him, had gone on. And the little
mother, brave in her white satin, with her long
veil trailing down from her wreath of orange
blossoms; she too, loved Rosemary; indeed,
with a holy deepening of her soul, she loved
the whole world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
the
Picture</div>

<p>The picture must have been taken very soon
after the ceremony. Rosemary fancied that
they had gone to the photographer's with one
or more of the wedding guests, while the
revelry and feasting still went on. And yet,
so soon, into the woman's eyes had come the
look of wistfulness, almost of prayer, as though
she had suddenly come face to face with the
knowledge that love, like a child, is man's to
give and woman's to keep, to guard, to nourish,
to suffer for, and, perhaps, last of all, to lose.</p>

<p>The mother-hunger woke in Rosemary a
strange longing. What joy to serve this little
mother, to whom her child was as unknown
then as now! What ecstasy to uncoil the
smooth strands of brown hair, take the white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
shoes from the tiny feet, destined to tread the
unfamiliar ways of pain; to breathe the soft
sweetness of her neck and arms! The big,
strong father, lovably boyish now, appealed to
her with a sense of shelter, for valiantly he
stood, or had tried to stand, between his child
and the world, but, from the other came
something more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Above
Everyday
Cares</div>

<p>"I think," said Rosemary, to herself, "that
she must have kissed me before she died."</p>

<p>That day she went about her tasks as might
a dweller from another planet, who had set
his body to carry on his appointed duties,
while his spirit roamed the blue infinite spaces
between the day-stars and the sun. Early in
the afternoon she left the house, without asking
whether she might go, or saying when she
would be back. She even had the audacity
to leave the luncheon dishes piled in the sink,
and unwashed.</p>

<p>At the foot of the Hill of the Muses, she
paused, then shook her head. She could never
go there again, though the thought of Alden
now brought no anguish&mdash;only a great sadness.
A mocking smile curled her lips at the memory
of her futile struggles toward stationery and a
stamp, that she might set him free. How
could he be more free than he was, untroubled,
doubtless, by even the thought of her?</p>

<p>She began to perceive, though dimly, the
divinity that shapes our humblest affairs. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
the search for an envelope, she had found her
father and mother, as was doubtless meant
from the beginning. Surely she had never
needed them more than she did now! If it
had been meant for her to have stationery,
and to set Alden free in that way, it would
have been mysteriously provided&mdash;she was
certain of that.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Clear
Path</div>

<p>She saw, too, that the way upon which we
are meant to go is always clear, or at least
indicated, at the time we are meant to take it;
that guidance is definitely felt through the
soul's own overpowering conviction. The
struggle and the terror fell away from her like
a garment she had cast aside, and for the
moment she emerged into freedom as before
she had come into love.</p>

<p>Deep in her heart she still loved Alden, but
unselfishly. This new Rosemary asked nothing
for herself, she only longed to give,
though freedom might be her best gift to him.
Harm could come to her only through herself;
the burning heart and the racked soul had been
under the dominion of Fear.</p>

<p>She took the path up along the river, that
lay half asleep and crooning drowsily to the
little clouds that were mirrored upon its
tranquil breast. Tiny blue pools among the
rushes at the bend in the stream gave back
glints of sapphire and turquoise, with now and
then a glimmer of gold. Sometimes, upon a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
hidden rock, the river swirled and rippled,
breaking murmurously into silver and pearl,
but steadily beneath, in spite of all outward
seeming, the current moved endlessly toward
its sea-born destiny, as Man himself unto the
Everlasting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pleasures
of the
Valley</div>

<p>Singing among the far hills, and rushing
downward in a torrent of ecstatic life, the
river had paused in the valley to rest, dreaming,
perchance, of the long cool shadows in
the uplands, the far altar-fires of daybreak.
There were pleasant things to do in the valley,
to lie at full length, basking in the sun, to hum
a bit of the old music, to touch gently the harp-strings
of the marsh grass and rushes, dimpling
with pleasure at the faint answer, to reflect
every passing mood of cloud and sky, even to
hold the little clouds as a mother might, upon
its deep and tender bosom. There were lily-pads
to look after, too, bird-shadows and
iridescent dragon flies, sunset lights to deepen
and spread afar, and, at night, all the starry
hosts of heaven to receive and give back, in
luminous mist, to the waiting dusk.</p>

<p>Dawn came to the river while the earth still
slept; it was day upon the waters while night
lingered upon the shore. And, too, long after
the abundant life of field and meadow was
stilled in dreamless peace, past the power of
the fairy lamp-bearers to stir or to annoy,
the river lay awake and watchful, as some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
divinely appointed guardian of the Soul of
Things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Murmur
of Voices</div>

<p>The peace of it came to Rosemary, as she
walked, with the sense of healing, of balm.
She saw plainly how Grandmother had wronged
her, every day of her life, but set resentment
aside, simply, as something that did not belong
to her. The appointed thing came at the
appointed time in the appointed way&mdash;there
was no terror save her own fear. Outside
herself was a mass of circumstance beyond her
control, but, within herself, was the power of
adjustment, as, when two dominant notes are
given, the choice of the third makes either
dissonance or harmony.</p>

<p>Tired, at last, for she had walked far upstream
into the hills, Rosemary sat down upon
a convenient rock to rest. The shores were
steep, now, but just beyond her was a little
cleft between two hills&mdash;a pleasant, sunny
space, with two or three trees and a great
rock, narrowing back into a thicket. She
went on, after a few moments, down the
slope to the level place, lay at full length
upon the thick turf, and drank thirstily from
the river.</p>

<p>In a moment, she heard the slow splash of
oars, and the murmur of voices, both low and
deep, though one evidently belonged to a man
and one to a woman. Boats were infrequent
upon the river, and, not caring to be seen, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
stepped back into the thicket until it should
pass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mute and
Frightened</div>

<p>The voices came nearer and nearer, the
man's full-toned and vaguely familiar, the
woman's musical, vibrant, and, in a way,
familiar too.</p>

<p>A single powerful stroke brought the boat
into view, as it rounded the curve. It was
Alden and Edith. The girl stepped back still
farther into the sheltering thicket, repressing
the cry of astonishment that rose to her lips.
Acutely self-conscious, it seemed that the
leaves were no protection; that she stood before
them helpless, unconcealed.</p>

<p>Trembling, she sat down on a low, flat stone,
for she had suddenly become too weak to
stand. Much to her dismay, Alden swung
the head of the boat toward the shore. They
were going to land!</p>

<p>Mute and frightened, she watched him as
he assisted her to the shore, saw him return
to the boat for a basket covered with a white
cloth, and draw the oars up to the bank.</p>

<p>Rosemary instantly comprehended the emotions
of an animal in a trap. She scarcely
dared to breathe, much less move. Unwilling
to listen, she put her fingers in her ears and
turned her head away, but presently the
position became so strained and uncomfortable
that she had to give it up. Their voices were
plainly audible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Picnic</div>

<p>"I thought I heard a rustle behind that
thicket," said Edith. She was lovely in her
gown of pale green linen, and carried a white
linen parasol instead of wearing a hat.</p>

<p>"It's a bird, or a squirrel," he assured her.
"Nobody ever comes here."</p>

<p>"Are we nobody?"</p>

<p>"Indeed not&mdash;we're everybody. The world
was made just for us two."</p>

<p>"I wish I could believe you," Edith returned,
sadly. Then she added, with swift irrelevance:
"Why do people always take hard-boiled eggs
to picnics?"</p>

<p>"To mitigate the pickles," he responded.
"There always are pickles&mdash;see? I knew
Mother would put some in."</p>

<p>"Wine, too," commented Edith, peering
into the basket. "Why, it's almost a party!"</p>

<p>Alden's face took on a grave, sweet boyishness.
"I did that myself," he said. "Mother
didn't know. Wait until I tell you. The
day I was born, my father set aside all the
wine that was that day ready for bottling.
There wasn't much of it. All these years,
it's been untouched on one particular shelf
in the storeroom, waiting, in dust and cobwebs.
At sunset he went to Mother, and told her
what he had done. 'It's for the boy,' he said.
'It's to be opened the day he finds the woman
he loves as I love you.'"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;" Edith's voice was almost a whisper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Time
Has Come</div>

<p>"The time has come. I may have found
her only to lose her again, but she's mine&mdash;for
to-day."</p>

<p>He filled two small glasses, and, solemnly,
they drank. The light mood vanished as
surely as though they had been in a church,
at some unwonted communion. Behind the
leafy screen, Rosemary trembled and shook.
She felt herself sharply divided into a dual
personality. One of her was serene and calm,
able to survey the situation unemotionally,
as though it were something that did not
concern her at all. The other was a deeply
passionate, loving woman, who had just seen
her life's joy taken from her for ever.</p>

<p>Alden, leaning back against the rock near
which they sat, was looking at Edith as a man
looks at but one woman in all his life. To
Rosemary, trembling and cold, it someway
brought a memory of her father's face, in the
faded picture. At the thought, she clenched her
hands tightly and compressed her lips. So
much she had, made hers eternally by a grave.
No one could take from her the thrilling sense
of kinship with those who had given her life.</p>

<p>Edith looked out upon the river. Her face
was wistful and as appealing as a child's.
"Found," she repeated, "though only to lose
again."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," he answered, hopefully.
"Wait and see."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Never
Again</div>

<p>"Life is made of waiting," she returned,
sadly&mdash;"woman's life always is." Then with
a characteristically quick change of mood, she
added, laughingly: "I know a woman who says
that all her life, before she was married, she
was waiting for her husband, and that since
her marriage, she has noticed no difference."</p>

<p>Alden smiled at the swift anti-climax, then
his face grew grave again. He packed the
few dishes in the basket, rinsed the wine
glasses in the river, brought them back, and
gave one to Edith.</p>

<p>"We'll break the bottle," he said, "and the
glasses, too. They shall never be used again."</p>

<p>The shattered crystal fell, tinkling as it went.
The wine made a deep, purple stain upon the
stone. He opened his arms.</p>

<p>"No," whispered Edith. "It only makes
it harder, when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beloved, have you found so much sweetness
in the world that you can afford to pass it
by?" She did not answer, so he said, pleadingly:
"Don't you want to come?"</p>

<p>She turned toward him, her face suddenly
illumined. "I do, with all my soul I do."</p>

<p>"Then come. For one little hour&mdash;for one
dear hour&mdash;ah, dearest, come!"</p>

<p>Rosemary averted her face, unable to bear
it. When she turned her miserable eyes toward
them again, allured by some strange
fascination she was powerless to analyse,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Edith was in his arms, her mouth crushed to
his.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Yours
Alone</div>

<p>"Dear, dearest, sweetheart, beloved!" the
man murmured. "I love you so!"</p>

<p>There was a pause, then he spoke again.
"Do you love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she breathed. "A thousand times,
yes!"</p>

<p>"Say it," he pleaded. "Just those three
words."</p>

<p>"I love you," she answered, "for everything
you have been and everything you are and
everything you are going to be, for always.
I love you with a love that is yours alone.
It never belonged to anybody else for the
merest fraction of a second, and never can.
It was born for you, lives for you, and will die
when you need it no more."</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "but I need it always. I've
wanted you all my life."</p>

<p>"And will," she sighed, trying to release
herself.</p>

<p>"Edith! Don't! I can't bear it! Take the
golden hour as the glittering sands of eternity
sweep past us. So much is yours and mine,
out of all that is past and to come."</p>

<p>"As you wish," she responded. Then, after
another pause, she said: "Don't you want to
read to me?"</p>

<p>Rosemary, dumb and hopeless, saw them
sit down, close together, and lean against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
rock, where the sunlight made an aureole of
Edith's hair. He slipped his arm around her,
and she laid her head upon his shoulder, with
a look of heavenly peace upon her pale face.
Never had the contrast between them been
more painful than now, for Edith, with
love in her eyes, was exquisite beyond all
words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Red Book
Again</div>

<p>Alden took a small red book out of his pocket.
With a pang, Rosemary recognised it. Was
nothing to be left sacred to her? She longed
to break from her hiding-place, face them both
with stern accusing eyes, snatch the book
which meant so much to her&mdash;ask for this
much, at least, to keep. Yet she kept still,
and listened helplessly, with the blood beating
in her ears.</p>

<p>In his deep, musical voice, Alden read once
more: <i>Her Gifts</i>. "That," he said, softly, "was
the night I knew."</p>

<p>"Yes," Edith answered. "The night I
found the book and brought it home."</p>

<p>Rosemary well remembered when Edith had
found the book. Her strange sense of a dual
self persisted, yet, none the less, her heart
beat hard with pain.</p>

<p>He went on, choosing a line here and there
as he turned the marked pages, but avoiding
entirely some of the most beautiful sonnets
because of their hopelessness. At last, holding
her closer, he began:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>"Oh!" breathed Rosemary, with her hands
tightly clenched. "Dear God, have pity!"</p>

<p>Heedlessly, Alden went on:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But April's sun strikes down the glades to-day;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>He dropped the book, lifted Edith's chin
and kissed her throat, then her mouth. She
laid her hand upon his face. "Dear and
lonely and hungry-hearted," she said; "how
long you wanted me!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he murmured, "but I've found you
now!"</p>

<p>How long they sat there, Rosemary never
knew, for her senses were dulled. She did not
hear their preparations for departure, but saw
the boat swinging out into the current, with
the sunset making golden glory of the river
and of Edith's hair. When the sound of the
oars ceased, she rose, numb and cold, and came
out into the open space. She steadied herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
for a moment upon the rock against which they
had leaned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Another

<p>"Service," she said to herself, "and sacrifice.
Giving, and not receiving. Asking&mdash;not

could be neither sacrifice nor denial, because
it was something she had never had.</p>

<p>She laughed, a trifle bitterly, and went on
home, another thought keeping time with her
footsteps. "The appointed thing comes at
the appointed time in the appointed way.
There is no terror save my own fear."</p>

<h2 class="chaphead">The Last Tryst</h2>


<div class="sidenote">A Double
Self</div>

<p>The shrill voices in the sitting-room rose
higher and higher. Since the day
Grandmother had read the article upon
"Woman's Birthright" to Matilda, the subject
of Mrs. Lee's hair had, as it were, been drowned
in cucumber milk. When Rosemary came in
from the kitchen, they appealed to her by
common consent.</p>

<p>"Rosemary, have you ever heard of anybody
taking a stool and a pail and goin' out
to milk the cucumbers before breakfast?"
This from Aunt Matilda.</p>

<p>"Rosemary, ain't you seen the juice of wild
cucumbers when they spit their seeds out and
ain't it just like milk, only some thicker?"
This from Grandmother.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Rosemary answered, mechanically.
The queer sense of a double self
persisted. One of her was calm and content,
the other was rebellious&mdash;and hurt.</p>

<p>"Humph!" snorted Grandmother.</p>

<p>"Humph!" echoed Aunt Matilda<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Going for
the Paper</div>

<p>"It's Thursday," Grandmother reminded
her, "and I heard the mail train come in some
time ago. You'd better leave the sweepin'
an' go and get my paper."</p>

<p>"Yes, do," Aunt Matilda chimed in, with a
sneer. "I can't hardly wait for this week's
paper, more'n the other sufferin' five million
can. Maybe there'll be a pattern for a cucumber
milkin' stool in this week's paper;
somethin' made out of a soap-box, with
cucumber leaves and blossoms painted on it
with some green and yellow house paint that
happens to be left over. And," she continued,
"they'd ought to be a pail too, but I reckon
a tin can'll do, for the cucumbers I've seen so
far don't look as if they'd be likely to give
much milk. We can paint the can green and
paste a picture of a cucumber on the outside
from the seed catalogue. Of course I ain't
got any freckles, but there's nothin' like havin'
plenty of cucumber milk in the house, with
hot weather comin' on."</p>

<p>Grandmother surveyed Matilda with a penetrating,
icy stare. "You've got freckles on
your mind," she said. "Rosemary, will you go
to the post-office and not keep me waiting?"</p>

<p>The girl glanced at her brown gingham
dress, and hesitated.</p>

<p>"You're clean enough," Grandmother observed,
tartly. "Anybody'd think you had a
beau waitin' for you somewheres."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Young
People's
Calls</div>

<p>She flushed to her temples, but did not
speak. Her face was still red when she went
out, wearing a brown straw hat three Summers
old.</p>

<p>"The paper says," Grandmother continued,
"that a blush is becomin' to some women, but
Rosemary ain't one that looks well with a
red face. Do you suppose she has got a
beau?"</p>

<p>"Can't prove it by me," Matilda sighed,
looking pensively out of the window. "That
Marsh boy come to see her once, though."</p>

<p>"He didn't come again, I notice, no more'n
the minister did."</p>

<p>"No," Matilda rejoined, pointedly, with a
searching glance at Grandmother, "and I
reckon it was for the same reason. When
young folks comes to see young folks, they
don't want old folks settin' in the room with
'em all the time, talkin' about things they
ain't interested in."</p>

<p>"Young folks!" snorted Grandmother.
"You was thirty!"</p>

<p>"That ought to be old enough to set alone
with a man for a spell, especially if he's a
minister."</p>

<p>"I suppose you think," the old lady returned,
swiftly gathering her ammunition for a final
shot, "that the minister was minded to
marry you. I've told you more 'n once
that you're better off the way you are.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Marriage ain't much. I've been through it
and I know."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Face to
Face</div>

<p>With that, she sailed triumphantly out of
the room, closing the door with a bang which
had in it the sound of finality. Poor Miss
Matilda gazed dreamily out of the window,
treasuring the faint, fragrant memory of her
lost romance. "If Rosemary has got a beau,"
she said to herself, "I hope she won't let Ma
scare him away from her."</p>

<p>At the post-office, Rosemary met Alden,
face to face. She blushed and stammered
when he spoke to her, answered his kindly
questions in monosyllables, and, snatching
<i>The Household Guardian</i> from the outstretched
hand of the postmaster, hurried away.</p>

<p>Presently he overtook her. "Please, Rosemary,"
he said, "give me just a minute. I
want to talk to you. I haven't seen you for
a long time."</p>

<p>"Yes?" She stopped, but could not raise
her eyes to his face.</p>

<p>"I can't talk to you here. Come on up the
hill."</p>

<p>"When?" The girl's lips scarcely moved
as she asked the question.</p>

<p>"Now. Please come."</p>

<p>"I'll&mdash;I'll have to go home first, with
this," she replied, indicating the paper. "Then
I'll come."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll go on ahead and wait for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
you. Shall I tie the red ribbon to the tree?"
He spoke thoughtlessly, meaning only to be
pleasant, but the girl's eyes filled. She shook
her head decisively and neither of them spoke
until they reached the corner where she must
turn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Waiting
for
Rosemary</div>

<p>"Good-bye," she said.</p>

<p>"Auf wiedersehen," he replied, lifting his
hat. "Don't be long."</p>

<p>Always, before, it had been Rosemary who
waited for him. Now he sat upon the log,
leaning back against the tree, listening to
the chatter of the squirrels and the twitter
of little birds in the boughs above him. It
was not yet noon, and the sunlight made
little dancing gleams of silver-gilt on the
ground between the faint shadows of the
leaves. He waited for her in a fever of
impatience, for in his pocket he had a letter
for Edith, addressed in a dashing masculine
hand.</p>

<p>Not so long ago, in this same place, he had
asked Rosemary to marry him. Now he must
ask her to release him, to set him free from
the bondage he had persisted in making for
himself. He made a wry face at the thought,
unspeakably dreading the coming interview
and, in his heart, despising himself.</p>

<p>Rosemary did not keep him waiting long.
When she came, she was flushed and breathless
from the long climb&mdash;and something more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
She sank down upon the seat he indicated&mdash;her
old place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hour
of
Reckoning</div>

<p>"It's been a long time since we were here
last," Alden observed, awkwardly.</p>

<p>"Has it?" The grey eyes glanced at him
keenly for a moment, then swiftly turned
away.</p>

<p>"I've&mdash;I've wanted to see you," Alden
lied.</p>

<p>"I've wanted to see you," she flashed
back, telling the literal truth.</p>

<p>Alden sighed, for there was tremulous passion
in her tone&mdash;almost resentment. He had
treated her badly, considering that she was
his promised wife. She had been shamefully
neglected, and she knew it, and the hour of
reckoning had come.</p>

<p>For the moment he caught at the straw the
situation seemed to offer him. If they should
quarrel&mdash;if he could make her say harsh things,
it might be easier. Instantly his better self
revolted. "Coward!" he thought. "Cad!"</p>

<p>"I've wanted to see you," Rosemary was
saying, with forced calmness, "to tell you
something. I can't marry you, ever!"</p>

<p>"Why, Rosemary!" he returned, surprised
beyond measure. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>The girl rose and faced him. He rose, too,
awkwardly stretching out his hand for hers.
She swerved aside, and clasped her hands
behind her back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">It's All a
Mistake</div>

<p>"I mean what I said; it's plain enough,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, putting his hands in
his pockets, "it's perfectly plain. If I've
done anything to hurt or offend you in any
way, I&mdash;I'm sorry." So much was true.
He was sorry for Rosemary and had never
been more so than at that very moment.
"You'll give me a reason, won't you?" he
continued.</p>

<p>"Reason?" she repeated, with a bitter
laugh. "Oh, I have plenty of reasons!"
His heart sank for a moment, then went on,
evenly. "It's all a mistake&mdash;it's never been
anything but a mistake. I couldn't leave
Grandmother and Aunt Matilda, you know.
They need me, and I shouldn't have allowed
myself to forget it."</p>

<p>"Yes," Alden agreed, quickly, "I suppose
they do need you. I was selfish, perhaps."</p>

<p>Hot words came to her lips but she choked
them back. For an instant she was tempted
to tell him all she had seen and heard a few
days before, to accuse him of disloyalty, and
then prove it. Her face betrayed her agitation,
but Alden was looking out across the valley, and
did not see. In his pocket the letter for Edith
lay consciously, as though it were alive.</p>

<p>"It isn't that you don't love me, is it?"
he asked, curiously. His masculine vanity
had been subtly aroused.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">They Part</div>

<p>Rosemary looked him straight in the face.
She was white, now, to the lips. "Yes," she
lied. "It is that more than anything else."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear girl! I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So did I. We were both mistaken, that
is all."</p>

<p>"And you really don't love me?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>Alden laughed&mdash;a little mirthless, mocking
laugh. It is astonishing, sometimes, how
deeply a man may be hurt through his vanity.
Rosemary had turned away, and he called
her back.</p>

<p>"Won't you kiss me good-bye?" he asked,
with a new humility.</p>

<p>Then Rosemary laughed, too, but her laugh
was also mirthless. "No," she answered, in
a tone from which there was no appeal. "Why
should I?" Before he realised it, she was
gone.</p>

<p>He went back to the log and sat down to
think. This last tryst with Rosemary had
been a surprise in more ways than one. He
had been afraid that she would be angry, or
hurt, and she had been neither. He had come
to ask for freedom and she had given it to
him without asking, because she could not leave
Grandmother and Aunt Matilda, and because
she did not love him. He could understand
the first reason, but the latter seemed very
strange. Yet Rosemary had looked him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
straight in the face and he had never known
her to lie. He had a new emotion toward her;
not exactly respect, but something more than
that.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Letter
for Edith</div>

<p>Then, with a laugh, he straightened his
shoulders. He had what he wanted, though
it had not come in the way he thought it would.
If he had been obliged to ask her to release
him, he would have felt worse than he did now.
The letter in his pocket, heavy with portent,
asserted itself imperiously. He hurried home,
feeling very chivalrous.</p>

<p>Edith, cool and fresh in white linen, with
one of the last of the red roses thrust into her
belt, was rocking on the veranda, with a book
in her lap which she had made no pretence
of reading. Two or three empty chairs were
near her, but Madame was nowhere to be seen.
Alden handed her the letter. "I'm free!"
he said, exultantly.</p>

<p>Edith smiled, then, with shaking hands,
tore open the letter. Alden eagerly watched
her as she turned the closely written pages,
but her face was inscrutable. She read every
word carefully, until she reached the signature.
Then she looked up.</p>

<p>"I'm not," she said, briefly. She tossed
the letter to him, and went into the house.
He heard her light feet upon the stairs and
the rustle of her skirts as she ascended. Perfume
persisted in the place she had just left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>&mdash;the
rose at her belt, the mysterious blending
of many sweet odours, and, above all, the
fragrance of Edith herself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alden
Reads the
Letter</div>

<p>"It's nonsense," he murmured, looking
after her. All her quixotic notions of honour
would eventually yield to argument&mdash;of course
they would. Yet his heart strangely misgave
him as he read the letter.</p>

<p>"My dear Edith," it began.</p>

<p>"Your letter has somewhat surprised me,
and yet I cannot say I feel that I don't deserve
it. Since you have been away I have been
doing a good deal of thinking. Of course you
and I haven't hit it off very well together,
and, as I can see no point where you have
failed me, I realise that it must be my fault
and that I have failed you.</p>

<p>"I wish you had talked to me about it,
instead of going away, and yet, even as I write
the words, I see how impossible it would have
been, for we haven't been in the habit of
talking things over since the first year we were
married. Gradually the wall of silence and
reserve has grown up between us, but while you,
with the quicker insight of a woman, have
seen it growing, I haven't realised it until it
was completed.</p>

<p>"Your offering me my freedom has made
me wonder what my life would be without
you. No one has ever filled your place to me,
or ever will. I may have seemed careless,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
thoughtless&mdash;indeed, I have been both, and
constantly, but always in the background has
been the knowledge that you were there&mdash;that
I could depend upon you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Husband's
Point of
View</div>

<p>"It may seem like a trite and commonplace
thing to say, but upon my word and honour,
Edith, I haven't meant to fail you, as I see
I have in a thousand ways. I'm sorry, deeply
sorry, but I know that the words will not mean
much to you.</p>

<p>"Since I first saw you, there's never been
any woman in the world for me but you, and
there never will be, even though you should
cast me off as I deserve. If you can make up
your mind to come back to me and let me
try again, I'll do my best to make you happy&mdash;to
consider you instead of myself.</p>

<p>"Men are selfish brutes at the best, and I
don't claim to be any better than the average,
but all I'm asking for now is a chance to make
myself worthy of you&mdash;to be the sort of husband
a woman like you should have.</p>

<p>"Please let me hear from you very soon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">"Your loving husband,</p>
<p style="margin-left:50%;">"W. G. L."</p>

<p>Alden read it again, though he did not need
to&mdash;he had understood every word of it the
first time. Then he folded it, slowly and
precisely, and put it into the torn envelope.
He tapped on the arm of the chair for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
moment with the edge of the envelope, then,
mechanically, put it into his pocket.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect
upon
Alden</div>

<p>A robin, in a maple tree beyond him, piped
his few notes with unbearable intensity. Discordant
chirps assailed his ears from the
lattice where the climbing rose put forth its
few last blooms. Swaying giddily in a crazy
pattern upon the white floor of the veranda,
was the shadow of the rose, the plaything of
every passing wind. He remembered the
moonlight night which might have been either
yesterday or in some previous life, as far as
his confused perceptions went, when Edith
had stood with the rose in her hand, and the
clear, sharply-defined shadow of it had been
silhouetted at her feet.</p>

<p>All his senses seemed mercilessly acute.
Some of the roses were almost dead and the
sickening scent of them mingled with the
fragrance of those that had just bloomed.
It made him dizzy&mdash;almost faint.</p>

<p>The maid announced luncheon, but food,
or the sight of his mother were among the
last things he desired, just then. Affecting
not to hear, he went out, got a boat, and rowed
far up the river alone.</p>

<p>When he was utterly exhausted, he shipped
the oars and let himself drift back, pushing
out from shore now and then when the current
brought him too near. He knew, with crushing
certainty, that Edith would not be swerved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
from her chosen path by argument&mdash;but he
could at least try.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Silent
Function</div>

<p>White-faced and weary, he went to his room
when he reached home, lay down, and tried
to sleep, but sleep would not come. He
seemed to have come to a point of absolute
bodily suspension, neither to hunger nor thirst
nor sleep again. It was, in a way, like a clock,
that ticks steadily, though the hands are
definitely fixed at a certain hour and will not
move.</p>

<p>He forced himself to dress for dinner and
to go down at the proper time. Madame was
waiting, but Edith was late. When she
appeared, she was in the white linen gown
she had worn all day, with the withered rose
in her belt. It was the first evening she had
not dressed for dinner and she at once apologised
to Madame.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said, "but it seemed impossible
to make the effort to-night. You'll
forgive me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course," Madame returned sweetly.</p>

<p>"Of course," Alden echoed. His voice
sounded distant and his eyes were dull.</p>

<p>As dinner bade fair to be a silent function,
Madame turned to Edith with the first question
that came into her mind.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing all the afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Packing," replied Edith, with dry lips.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nothing to
Say</div>

<p>"Or rather, getting ready to pack." She did
not look at Alden, but at Madame, with a wan
little smile that made the old lady's heart
suddenly very tender toward her.</p>

<p>"My dear! We'll miss you so."</p>

<p>"I know," Edith murmured, "and I shall
miss you&mdash;more than words may say, but I
have to go." She drained the glass of water
at her plate, then added: "My husband wants
me to come back. He has written to say so."</p>

<p>"Then," said Madame, "I suppose you
will have to go."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," repeated Edith, parrot-like.</p>

<p>Alden's eyes never swerved from Edith's
white face. In their depths was the world-old
longing, the world-old appeal, but never
for the fraction of an instant did Edith trust
herself to look at him.</p>

<p>When they rose from the table, Edith went
back to her room immediately, murmuring
an excuse. Alden watched her despairingly
until the hem of her white gown was lost at the
turn of the stairs. Then he sat down with the
paper, but he could not read, for the words
zig-zagged crazily along the page.</p>

<p>Madame understood and sincerely pitied
them both, but there seemed to be nothing
to say. She leaned back in her chair, with her
eyes closed, pretending to be asleep, but, in
reality, watching Alden as he stared vacantly
at the paper he held in his shaking hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Poor
Comfort</div>

<p>At last he rose and went out upon the
veranda. Madame started from her chair,
then forced herself to lean back again, calmly.
She heard the scraping of his chair as he moved
it along the veranda, out of the way of the
light that came through the open window.
For a long time there was silence.</p>

<p>Longing to comfort him and unable to endure
it longer, Madame went out, softly. He did
not hear her step, for his head was bowed upon
his hands. From a room above Edith's light
streamed out afar into the sweet darkness,
drawing toward it all the winged wayfarers of
the night.</p>

<p>Madame slipped her arm around his shoulders,
and bent down to him. "Dear," she
said brokenly, "she's married."</p>

<p>Alden drew a quick, shuddering breath,
and freed himself roughly from the tender
clasp. "I know it, Mother," he cried, in a
voice vibrant with pain. "For God's sake,
don't remind me of that!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edith's
Failure</div>

<p>Through the long night Edith lay awake,
thinking. Her senses were blindly
merged into one comprehensive hurt. She was
as one who fares forth in darkness, knowing
well the way upon which he must go, yet
longing vainly for light.</p>

<p>Her path lay before her, mercilessly clear
and distinct. A trick of memory took her
back to what Madame had said, the day after
she came: "The old way would have been to
have waited, done the best one could, and
trusted God to make it right in His good time."
She remembered, too, her bitter answer: "I've
waited and I've done the best I could, and
I've trusted, but I've failed."</p>

<p>Keenly she perceived the subtlety of her
punishment. Attempting to bind the Everlasting
with her own personal limitations, her
own desires, she had failed to see that at least
half of a rightful prayer must deal with herself.
She had asked only that her husband might love
her; not that she might continue to love him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Out of
Harmony</div>

<p>Now, with her heart and soul wholly in the
keeping of another man, the boon had been
granted her, in bitterness and ashes and
desolation. He had said, in his letter, that
her coming away had made him think. Through
her absence he had seen the true state of affairs
between them, as she could never have made
him see it if she had remained at home. This,
then, was God's way of revelation to him, but&mdash;to
her?</p>

<p>The truth broke upon her with the vividness
of a lightning flash. It was the way of revelation
to her also, but how? She sat up in bed,
propping herself back against the pillows, her
mind groping eagerly for the clue.</p>

<p>During the past six years she had endeavoured
constantly for a certain adjustment.
Now it had come, but she herself was out of
harmony. Were her feet to be forever set
upon the ways of pain? Was there nothing
at all in the world for her?</p>

<p>Alden, too, was awake and thinking. She
felt it, through the darkness, as definitely as
though he had been in the same room, with
his face full in the light. He also was conscious
of the utter hopelessness of it and was
striving to see his way clearly.</p>

<p>Until then, she had not known how far his
argument had swayed her, nor how much she
had depended upon the thought that her
husband would gladly accept the release she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
offered him. Her principles had not changed,
but his possible point of view had not been
considered before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Irrevocably
Bound</div>

<p>"'Until death do us part,'" said Edith,
to herself. "Not 'until death or divorce do
us part'; nor yet 'until I see someone else I
like better'; not even 'until you see someone
else you like better,' And, again, 'forsaking
all others keep thee only unto me so long as
we both shall live.'"</p>

<p>Suppose he had violated his oath, consented
to accept freedom at her hands, and gone his
way? Would not the solemn words she had
spoken at the altar still be binding upon her?
She saw, now, that they would be, and that
whatever compromise he might have been
able to make with his own conscience, to be
legally justified later, she was irrevocably
bound, until death should divide them one
from the other.</p>

<p>She smiled sadly, for it was, indeed, a confused
and muddled world. Things moved
crazily, depending wholly upon blind chance.
One works steadily, even for years, bending
all his energies to one single point, and what
is the result? Nothing! Another turns the
knob of a door, walks into a strange room, or,
perhaps, writes a letter, and from that moment
his whole life is changed, for destiny lurks in
hinges and abides upon the written page.</p>

<p>For days, for months even, no single action<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
may be significant, and again, upon another
day, a thoughtless word, or even a look, may
be as a pebble cast into deep waters, to reach,
by means of ever-widening circles, some distant,
unseen shore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The One
Affected</div>

<p>All this had come from a single sentence.
Louise Archer, upon her death-bed, had
harked back to her school days, and, thinking
fondly of Virginia Marsh, had bade her daughter
go to her if she felt the need of a mother's
counsel when her own mother was past the
power of giving it. Years afterward, during
a day of despondency, Edith had remembered.
The pebble had fallen deep and far and had
become still again, but its final circle had that
day touched the ultimate boundary made by
three lives.</p>

<p>It had, of course, made no difference to
Madame, but two men and a woman had been
profoundly shaken by it, though not moved
from their original position. They would all
stay where they were, of course&mdash;Alden with
his mother, and Edith with her husband. Then,
with a shock, Edith remembered Rosemary&mdash;she
was the one who had been swept aside as
though by a tidal wave.</p>

<p>Poor Rosemary! Edith's heart throbbed
with understanding pity for the girl who had
lost all. She had not asked how it had
happened, merely accepting Alden's exultant
announcement. Now she hoped that it might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
have been done delicately, so that Alden need
not feel himself a brute, nor Rosemary's pride
be hurt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A
Sleepless
Night</div>

<p>Then, through the night, came a definite
perception, as though Alden himself had given
her assurance. Rosemary had done it herself,
had she? Very well&mdash;that was as it should be.
For a moment she dwelt upon the fact with
satisfaction, then, a little frightened, began to
speculate upon this mysterious tie between
herself and Alden.</p>

<p>The thing was absurd, impossible. She
curled her short upper lip scornfully in the
darkness. "You know it is," she said, imperiously,
in her thought, as though in answer
to a mocking question from somewhere:
"Is it?"</p>

<p>She turned restlessly. All at once her
position became tiresome, unbearable. She
wanted to go to sleep, indeed she must sleep,
for she had a long hard day before her to-morrow,
putting her things into her trunks.
Perhaps, if she rose and walked around her
room a little&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>One small, pink foot was on the floor, and
the other almost beside it, when a caution
came to her from some external source: "Don't.
You'll take cold." She got back into bed,
shivering a little. Yes, the polished floor was
cold.</p>

<p>Then she became furious with Alden and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
with herself. Why couldn't the man go to
sleep? It must be past midnight, now, and
she would walk, if she wanted to. Defiantly
and in a triumph of self-assertion, she went to
the open window and peered out into the
stillness, illumined by neither moon nor stars.
The night had the suffocating quality of
hangings of black velvet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sitting in
the Dark</div>

<p>She lighted a candle, found her kimono and
slippers, wrapped herself in a heavy blanket,
and drew up a low rocker to the open window.
Then she put out the light and settled herself
to wait until she was sleepy.</p>

<p>The darkness that clung around her so
closely seemed alive, almost thrilling, as it
did, with fibres of communication perceptible
only to a sixth sense. She marvelled at the
strangeness of it, but was no longer afraid.
Her fear had vanished at the bidding of someone
else.</p>

<p>Why was it? she asked herself, for the
hundredth time, and almost immediately the
answer came: "Why not?"</p>

<p>Why not, indeed? If a wireless telegraph
instrument, sending its call into space, may be
answered with lightning-like swiftness by
another a thousand miles away, why should
not a thought, without the clumsy medium of
speech, instantly respond to another thought
from a mind in harmony with it?</p>

<p>A subtle analogy appeared between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
earth and the body, the tower from which the
wireless signalled and the thought which called
to another. When the physical forces were at
their lowest ebb, and the powers of the spirit
had risen to keep the balance true, why was
not communication possible always between
soul and soul? And, if one lived always above
the fog of sense, as far as the earth-bound may,
what would be the need of speech or touch
between those who belonged to one another?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two
Views</div>

<p>She and Alden "belonged," there was no
doubt of that. She had, for him, the woman's
recognition of her mate, which is never to be
mistaken or denied when once it has asserted
itself. "Why," she thought, "will people
marry without it?" The other mind responded
instantly: "Because they don't know."</p>

<p>Marriage presented itself before her in two
phases, the one sordid and unworthy, as it so
often is, the other as it might be&mdash;the earthly
seal upon a heavenly bond. But, if the
heavenly relationship existed, was the other
essential? Her heart answered "No."</p>

<p>Slowly she began to see her way through the
maze of things. "Dust to dust, earth to earth,
ashes to ashes." Then she laughed outright,
for that was part of the burial service, and
she had been thinking of something else.
And yet&mdash;earth to earth meant only things
that belonged together; why not soul to soul?</p>

<p>Warm tides of assurance and love flowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
through her heart, cleansing, strengthening,
sweeping barriers aside in a mighty rush of
joy. What barriers could earth interpose,
when two belonged to each other in such
heavenly ways as this? Step by step her soul
mounted upward to the heights, keeping pace
with another, in the room beyond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edith's
Revelation</div>

<p>Out of sound and sight and touch, with
darkened spaces and closed doors between,
they two faced the world together as surely
as though they were hand in hand. Even
Death could make no difference&mdash;need Life
deny them more?</p>

<p>Then, with a blinding flash of insight, the
revelation came to her&mdash;there was no denial,
since they loved. Sense, indeed, was wholly
put aside, but love has nothing to do with
sense, being wholly of the soul. Shaken with
wonder, she trembled as she sat in her chair,
staring out into the starless night.</p>

<p>No denial! All that Love might give was
theirs, not only for the moment but for all the
years to come. Love&mdash;neither hunger nor
thirst nor passion nor the need of sleep; neither
a perception of the senses nor a physical demand,
yet streaming divinely through any or
all of these as only light may stream&mdash;the
heavenly signal of a star to earth, through infinite
darkness, illimitable space.</p>

<p>By tortuous paths and devious passages,
she had come out upon the heights, into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
clear upper air of freedom and of love. Exquisitely,
through the love of the one had come
the love of the many; the complete mastery
of self had been gained by the surrender of
self; triumph had rewarded sacrifice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Her
Understanding
of
Love</div>

<p>Nothing was difficult now&mdash;nothing would
ever be hard again. To go where she was
wanted, to give what she could that was
needed, steadily to set self aside, asking for
nothing but the opportunity to help, and
through this high human service renewing the
spent forces of her soul at the divine fountains
that do not fail&mdash;this, indeed, was Love!</p>

<p>Oh, to make the others understand as she
understood now&mdash;and as Alden understood!
In her thought they two were as one. Groping
through the same darkness, he had emerged,
with her, into the same light; she felt it through
the living, throbbing night more certainly
than if they stood face to face in the blinding
glare of the sun.</p>

<p>The heart-breaking tragedy of Woman
revealed itself wholly to her for the first time.
Less materialistic and more finely-grained
than Man, she aspires toward things that are
often out of his reach. Failing in her aspiration,
confused by the effort to distinguish the false
from the true, she blindly clutches at the
counterfeit and so loses the genuine forever.</p>

<p>Longing, from the day of her birth for Love,
she spends herself prodigally in the endless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
effort to find it, little guessing, sometimes, that
it is not the most obvious thing Man has to
offer. With colour and scent and silken sheen,
she makes a lure of her body; with cunning
artifice she makes temptation of her hands
and face and weaves it with her hair. She
flatters, pleads, cajoles; denies only that she
may yield, sets free in order to summon back,
and calls, so that when he has answered she
may preserve a mystifying silence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Her
Estimate
of Women</div>

<p>She affects a thousand arts that in her heart
she despises, pretends to housewifery that she
hates, forces herself to play tunes though she
has no gift for music, and chatters glibly of
independence when she has none at all.</p>

<p>In making herself "all things to all men," she
loses her own individuality, and becomes no
more than a harp which any passing hand may
strike to quick response. To one man she is
a sage, to another an incarnate temptation, to
another a sensible, business-like person, to
another a frothy bit of frivolity. To one man
she is the guardian of his ideals, as Elaine in
her high tower kept Launcelot's shield bright
for him, to another she is what he very vaguely
terms "a good fellow," with a discriminating
taste in cigarettes and champagne.</p>

<p>Let Man ask what he will and Woman will
give it, praying only that somewhere she will
come upon Love. She adapts herself to him
as water adapts itself to the shape of the vessel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
in which it is placed. She dare not assert
herself or be herself, lest, in some way, she
should lose her tentative grasp upon the
counterfeit which largely takes the place of
love. If he prefers it, she will expatiate upon
her fondness for vaudeville and musical comedy
until she herself begins to believe that she
likes it. With tears in her eyes and her throat
raw, she will choke upon the assertion that
she likes the smell of smoke; she will assume
passion when his slightest touch makes her
shudder and turn cold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Her
Estimate
of Women</div>

<p>And, most pitiful of all, when blinded by
her own senses, she will surrender the last
citadel of her womanhood to him who comes
a-wooing, undismayed by the weeping women
around her whose sacred altars have been
profaned and left bare. They may have told
her that if it is love, the man will protect her
even against himself, but why should she
take account of the experience of others?
Has not he himself just told her that she is
different from all other women? Hugging
this sophistry to her breast, and still searching
for love, she believes him until the day of
realisation dawns upon her&mdash;old and broken
and bitter-hearted, with scarcely a friend left
in the world, and not even the compensating
coin thriftily demanded by her sister of the
streets.</p>

<p>Under her countless masques and behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
her multitudinous phases, lurks the old hunger,
the old appeal. Man, too, though more rarely,
guessing that the imperishable beauty of the
soul is above the fog of sense and not in it,
searches hopefully at first, then despairingly,
and finally offers the counterfeit to the living
Lie who is waiting for it with eager, outstretched
hands.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote">The
Clouds
Break</div>

<p>Stirred to the depths by the pity of it,
Edith brushed away a tear or two. She was
not at all sleepy, but drew the blanket closer
around her, for the night grew chill as the
earth swept farther and farther away from the
sun. The clouds had begun to drift away,
and faintly, through the shadow, glimmered one
pale star. Gradually, others came out, then
a white and ghostly moon, with a veil of cloud
about it, grey, yet iridescent, like mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>Blown far across the seas of space by a
swiftly rising wind, the clouds vanished, and
all the starry hosts of heaven marched forth,
challenging the earth with javelins of light.</p>

<p>"Starbreak," murmured Edith, "up there
and in my soul."</p>

<p>The blue rays of the love-star burned low
upon the grey horizon, that star towards
which the eyes of women yearn and which
women's feet are fain to follow, though, like
a will-o'-the-wisp, it leads them through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
strange and difficult places, and into the
quicksands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fellowship
with the
World</div>

<p>The body grows slowly, but the soul progresses
by leaps and bounds. Through a single
hurt or a single joy, the soul of a child may
reach man's estate, never to go backward,
but always on. And so, through a great love
and her own complete comprehension of its
meaning, Edith had grown in a night out of
herself, into a beautiful fellowship with the
whole world.</p>

<p>Strangely uplifted and forever at peace,
she rose from her chair. The blanket slipped
away from her, and her loosened hair flowed
back over her shoulders, catching gleams of
starlight as it fell. She stretched out her arms
in yearning toward Alden, her husband, Madame&mdash;indeed,
all the world, having come out
of self into service; through the love of one
to the love of all.</p>

<p>Then, through the living darkness, came the
one clear call: "Mine?"</p>

<p>Unmistakably the answer surged back: "In
all the ways of Heaven and for always, I am
thine."</p>

<div class="sidenote">When the
Shadows
Lengthen</div>

<p>The last of the packing was done, and four
trunks stood in the lower hall, waiting
for the expressman. Alden had not seen Edith
that day, though he had haunted the house
since breakfast, waiting and hoping for even
a single word.</p>

<p>She had been too busy to come down to
luncheon, and had eaten only a little from the
tray Madame sent to her room. She was to
take the early train in the morning.</p>

<p>The afternoon shadows had begun to
lengthen when she came down, almost as white
as her fresh linen gown, but diffusing about her
some radiance from within that seemed not
wholly of earth. He met her at the foot of
the stairs, and took her hand in his.</p>

<p>"Edith! I've been longing for you all
day!"</p>

<p>"And I for you," she returned, avoiding
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Listen, dear. Give me the rest of it, won't
you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">For the
Last Time</div>

<p>"The rest of what?"</p>

<p>"The little time you have left with us&mdash;this
afternoon and to-night."</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated, then looked
him full in the face, her eyes mutely questioning
his.</p>

<p>"I won't," he said. "I promise you that."</p>

<p>"Then I'll come."</p>

<p>"Out on the river?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It's for the last time, Edith," he said,
sadly; "the very last time."</p>

<p>"I know," she returned. Her lips quivered
a little, but her eyes did not falter. Clear
and steadfast they looked far beyond him
into the future where he had no part. The
golden lights in them seemed signal fires now,
summoning him mysteriously onward to some
high service, not alien, even though apart
from her.</p>

<p>They said no more until they were in the
boat, swinging out upon the sunlit river. Then
Edith glanced at him, half shyly.</p>

<p>"Wasn't last night wonderful?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't it!" he echoed. "I never understood
before."</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>She trailed a white hand in the water as they
sped up stream. The light touched her hair
lovingly, bringing gleams of gold and amber
from the depths.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Alden's
Silence</div>

<p>"Dear," he said, "did you think that, after
last night, I could urge you to violate your
solemn oath or even to break your word?"</p>

<p>"I hoped not, but I didn't know."</p>

<p>"I see it all clearly now. If more was
meant for us to have, more would be right for
us to take. Back in the beginning this was
meant for you and me&mdash;just this, and nothing
more."</p>

<p>"How could there be more? Isn't love
enough?"</p>

<p>"Surely, but the separation hurts. Never
even to see your face or touch your hand
again!"</p>

<p>"I know," she said, softly. "I'll want you,
too."</p>

<p>A thousand things struggled for utterance,
but, true to his word, he remained silent.
His whole nature was merged into an imperious
demand for her, the cry of the man's soul
for the woman who belonged to him by divine
right.</p>

<p>"If love were all," she breathed, as though
in answer to it, "I'd come."</p>

<p>"If love were all," he repeated. "I wonder
why it isn't? What is there on earth aside
from this? What more can heaven be than
love&mdash;without the fear of parting?"</p>

<p>"No more," she replied. "We've lost
each other in this life, but there's another
life to come."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Whirling
Atoms</div>

<p>"'Helen's lips are drifting dust,'" he
quoted.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. That which once was Helen
may be alive to-day in a thousand different
forms. A violet upon a mossy bank, a bough
of apple blossoms mirrored in a pool, the
blood upon some rust-stained sword, a woman
waiting, somewhere, for a lover who does not
come."</p>

<p>"And her soul?"</p>

<p>"Drawn back into the Universal soul, to
be born anew, in part or all."</p>

<p>"What a pagan you are!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she responded, smiling a little, "I
am pagan and heathen and Christian martyr
and much else. I am everything that I can
understand and nothing that I cannot. Don't
you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see, but what are we after all? Only
two whirling atoms, blown on winds of Fate.
What difference does it make whether we cling
together, or are hopelessly sundered, as far
apart as the poles?"</p>

<p>"The same difference that it makes to a
human body whether its atoms behave or
not. You don't want to upset the Universe,
do you?"</p>

<p>He laughed, a trifle bitterly. "I don't
flatter myself that I could."</p>

<p>"Not you alone, nor I, nor even both together,
but we mustn't set a bad example to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>

<p>"What is right?" he demanded, roughly.
"Always to do the thing you don't want to
do?"</p>

<p>"That depends," she returned, shrugging
her shoulders. "It is to do what you think
is right, and trust that it may be so."</p>

<p>Alden stopped rowing. He was interested
in these vague abstractions. "And," he said,
"if a woman thinks it is her duty to murder
her husband, and does it, is she doing
right?"</p>

<p>"Possibly. I've seen lots of husbands who
would make the world better by leaving it,
even so&mdash;well, abruptly, as you indicate.
And the lady you speak of, who, as it were,
assists, may merely have drawn a generous
part of Lucretia Borgia for her soul-substance,
and this portion chanced to assert itself while
her husband was in the house and out of
temper."</p>

<p>"Don't be flippant, darling. This is our
last day together. Let's not play a waltz
at an open grave."</p>

<p>The long light lay upon the tranquil waters,
and, as a mirror might, the river gave it back
a hundred-fold, sending stray gleams into
the rushes at the bend in the stream, long
arrows of impalpable silver into the far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
shadows upon the shore, and a transfiguring
radiance to Edith's face.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A
Rainbow</div>

<p>Where the marsh swerved aside to wait
until the river passed, the sunlight took a tall,
purple-plumed iris, the reflection of the turquoise
sky in a shallow pool, a bit of iridescence
from a dragon-fly's wing, the shimmering green
of blown grasses and a gleam of rising mist
to make a fairy-like rainbow that, upon the
instant, disappeared.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Edith. "Did you see?"</p>

<p>"See what, dearest?"</p>

<p>"The rainbow&mdash;just for a moment, over the
marsh?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. Do you expect me to hunt
for rainbows while I may look into your
face?"</p>

<p>The faint colour came to her cheeks, then
receded. "Better go on," she suggested,
"if we're to get where we're going before
dark."</p>

<p>The oars murmured in the water, then rain
dripped from the shining blades. The strong
muscles of his body moved in perfect unison
as the boat swept out into the sunset glow.
Deeper and more exquisite with every passing
moment, the light lay lovingly upon the
stream, bearing fairy freight of colour and
gold to the living waters that sang and crooned
and dreamed from hills to sea.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem," she said, "as though it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
were the last time. With earth so beautiful,
how can people be miserable?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Perfect
Spring
Day</div>

<p>"Very easily," he responded. The expression
of his face changed ever so little, and
lines appeared around his mouth.</p>

<p>"I remember," Edith went on, "the day
my mother died. It was a perfect day late
in the Spring, when everything on earth seemed
to exult in the joy of living. Outside, it was
life incarnate, with violets and robins and
apple blossoms and that ineffable sweetness
that comes only then. Inside, she lay asleep,
as pale and cold as marble. At first, I couldn't
believe it. I went outside, then in again.
One robin came to the tree outside her window
and sang until my heart almost broke with
the pain of it. And every time I've heard a
robin since, it all comes back to me."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Alden, quietly, "but all the
life outside was made from death, and the
death within had only gone on to life again.
You cannot have one without the other, any
more than you can have a light without a
shadow somewhere."</p>

<p>"Nor a shadow," Edith continued, "without
knowing that somewhere there must be
light."</p>

<p>They stopped at the cleft between the hills,
where they had been the other day, but this
time no one waited, with breaking heart,
behind the rustling screen of leaves. Against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the rock, with some simple woodcraft of
stones and dry twigs, Alden made a fire,
while Edith spread the white cloth that
covered Madame's basket and set forth the
dainty fare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At Sunset</div>

<p>They ate in silence, not because there was
nothing to say, but because there was so much
that words seemed empty and vain. Afterward,
when the flaming tapestry in the West
had faded to a pale web of rose and purple,
faintly starred with exquisite lamps of
gleaming pearl, he came to her, and, without
speaking, took her into his arms.</p>

<p>For a long time they stood there, heart to
heart, in that rapturous communion wholly
transcending sense. To him it was not because
she was a woman; it was because she was Edith,
the mate of his heart and soul. And, to her,
it was a subtle completion of herself, the best
of her answering eagerly to the best in him.</p>

<p>At last, with a sigh, he pushed her gently
away from him, and looked down into her eyes
with a great sadness.</p>

<p>"Never any more, beloved. Have you
thought of that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," she whispered. "Never
any more."</p>

<p>"I'll want you always."</p>

<p>"And I you."</p>

<p>"Sometimes my heart will almost break
with longing for you, craving the dear touch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
of you, though it might be only to lay my
hand upon your face."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Day's
Duty</div>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>"And at night, when I dream that we're
somewhere together, and I reach out my arms
to hold you close, I'll wake with a start, to
find my arms empty and my heart full."</p>

<p>"The whole world lies between us, dear."</p>

<p>"And heaven also, I think."</p>

<p>"No, not heaven, for there we shall find
each other again, with no barriers to keep us
apart."</p>

<p>"I shall live only to make myself worthy of
finding you, dearest. I have nothing else to
do."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you have."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The day's duty, always; the thing that
lies nearest your hand. You know, I've
begun to see that it isn't so much our business
to be happy as it is to do the things we are
meant to do. And I think, too, that happiness
comes most surely to those who do not go out
in search of it, but do their work patiently,
and wait for it to come."</p>

<p>"That may be true for others, but not for us.
What happiness is there in the world for me,
apart from you?"</p>

<p>"Memory," she reminded him gently.
"We've had this much and nobody can
take it away from us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Memories</div>

<p>"But even this will hurt, heart's dearest,
when we see each other no more."</p>

<p>"Not always." As she spoke, she sat down
on the ground and leaned back against a tree.
He dropped down beside her, slipped his arm
around her, and drew her head to his shoulder,
softly kissing her hair.</p>

<p>"I remember everything," she went on,
"from the time you met me at the station.
I can see you now as you came toward me,
and that memory is all by itself, for nobody
at the very first meeting looks the same as
afterward. There is always some subtle
change&mdash;I don't know why. Do I look the
same to you now as I did then?"</p>

<p>"You've always been the most beautiful
thing in the world to me, since the first moment
I saw you."</p>

<p>"No, not the first moment."</p>

<p>"When was it, then, darling?"</p>

<p>"The first night, when I came down to
dinner, in that pale green satin gown. Don't
you remember?"</p>

<p>"As if I could ever forget!"</p>

<p>"And you thought I looked like a tiger-lily."</p>

<p>"Did I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you didn't say it and I was glad,
for so many other men had said it before."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was because, past all your
splendour, I saw you&mdash;the one perfect and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
peerless woman God made for me and sent
to me too late."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kisses</div>

<p>"Not too late for the best of it, dear."</p>

<p>"What else do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Everything. I haven't forgotten a word
nor a look nor a single kiss. The strange
sweet fires in your eyes, the clasp of your arms
around me, your lips on mine, the nights
we've lain awake with love surging from heart
to heart and back again&mdash;it's all strung for me
into a rosary of memories that nothing can
ever take away."</p>

<p>"That first kiss, beloved. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was here." She stretched out her
arm and with a rosy finger-tip indicated the
bare, sweet hollow of her elbow, just below the
sleeve.</p>

<p>Lover-like, he kissed it again. "Do you
love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Boy&mdash;for always."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Better than everything else in the world.
Do you love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with all my heart and soul and
strength and will. There isn't a fibre of me
that doesn't love you."</p>

<p>"For always?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for always."</p>

<p>And so they chanted the lover's litany until
even the afterglow had died out of the sky.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Edith released herself from his clinging arms.
"We must go," she sighed. "It's getting
late."</p>

<div class="sidenote">If</div>

<p>He assisted her to her feet, and led her to
the boat, moored in shallows that made a
murmurous singing all around it and upon the
shore. He took her hand to help her in, then
paused.</p>

<p>"If love were all," he asked, "what would
you do?"</p>

<p>"If love were all," she answered, "I'd put
my arms around you, like this, never to be
unclasped again. I'd go with you to-night,
to the end of the world, and ask for nothing
but that we might be together. I'd face
the heat of the desert uncomplainingly, the
cold of perpetual snows. I'd bear anything,
suffer anything, do anything. I'd so merge
my life with yours that one heart-beat would
serve us both, and when we died, we'd go together&mdash;if
love were all."</p>

<p>"God bless you, dear!" he murmured, with
his lips against hers.</p>

<p>"And you. Come."</p>

<p>The boat swung out over the shallows into
the middle of the stream, where the current
took them slowly and steadily toward home.
For the most part they drifted, though Alden
took care to keep the boat well out from shore,
and now and then, with the stroke of an oar
dipped up a myriad of mirrored stars.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Seeking
for a
Message</div>

<p>Edith laughed. "Give me one, won't you,
please?"</p>

<p>"You shall have them all."</p>

<p>"But I asked only for one."</p>

<p>"Then choose."</p>

<p>She leaned forward, in the scented shadow,
serious now, with a quick and characteristic
change of mood. "The love star," she
breathed. "Keep it burning for me, will you,
in spite of clouds and darkness&mdash;for always?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my queen&mdash;for always."</p>

<p>When they reached the house, Madame was
nowhere in sight. Divining their wish to be
alone on this last evening together, she had
long since gone to her own room. The candles
on the mantel had been lighted and the reading
lamp burned low. Near it was the little red
book that Edith had found at the top of the
Hill of the Muses.</p>

<p>Sighing, she took it up. "How long ago it
seems," she said, "and yet it wasn't. Life
began for me that night."</p>

<p>"And for me. I read to you, do you remember,
just before I kissed you for the first time?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Read to me again just before you
kiss me for the last time, then give me the
book to keep."</p>

<p>"Which one? The same?"</p>

<p>"No," cried Edith. "Anything but that!"</p>

<p>"Then choose. Close your eyes, and choose."</p>

<p>"It's like seeking for a message, or a sign,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
she said, as she swiftly turned the pages.
Then, with her eyes still closed, she offered him
the book. "Here&mdash;read this. Is it a blank
page?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Severed
Selves</div>

<p>There was a pause, then Edith opened her
eyes. "It isn't the first one you read to me,
is it? Don't tell me that it is!"</p>

<p>"No," said Alden, "it isn't, but it's a
message. Listen."</p>

<p>She sat down, in her old place, but he stood
at the table, bending toward the light. His
boyish mouth trembled a little, his hands were
unsteady, and there was a world of love and
pain in his eyes. With his voice breaking
upon the words, he read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Two separate divided silences,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which, brought together, would find loving voice;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Two glances which together would rejoice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In love, now lost like stars beyond dark trees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two hands apart, whose touch alone gives ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Two bosoms which, heart-shrined with mutual flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Would, meeting in one clasp, be made the same;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two souls, the shores wave-mocked of sundering seas:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such are we now. Ah! may our hope forecast<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Indeed one hour again, when on this stream<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of darkened love once more the light shall gleam?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hour how slow to come, how quickly past,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which blooms and fades, and only leaves at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Faint as shed flowers, the attenuated dream."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For a moment the silence was tense. Then
the hall clock struck the hour of midnight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
It beat upon their senses like a funeral knell.
Then Edith, white-faced, and struggling valiantly
for self-control, reached out her hand
for the book.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good-bye</div>

<p>"Good-night, Boy," she said, "for the
last time."</p>

<p>"Good-night," he answered, gathering her
into his arms.</p>

<p>"And good-bye, Boy, forever!"</p>

<p>"Forever," he echoed, "good-bye!"</p>

<p>He kissed her again, not with passion, but
with the love that has risen above it. Then
she released herself, and, holding the little
red book against her heart, ran quickly
up-stairs.</p>

<p>He waited until the echo of her footsteps
had died away, and her door had closed softly.
Then he put out the lights, and sat there for
a long time in the darkness, thinking, before
he went to his room.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grandmother's
Loss</div>

<p>"They ain't on the bureau and they ain't
on the washstand, and I disremember
takin' 'em out last night when I went to bed,
so I must have swallered 'em." Grandmother's
speech was somewhat blurred but her meaning
was distinct.</p>

<p>"Well," returned Matilda, with aggravating
calmness, "if you have swallowed 'em, you
have, so what of it?"</p>

<p>"Matilda Starr! I should think you'd
have some human feelin's about you somewheres.
Here your mother's gone and swallered
her false teeth and you set there, not
tryin' to do anything for her."</p>

<p>"What can I do? I can't stand on a chair
and swing you by your feet, same as Mis'
Bates did when her little Henry choked on a
marble, can I? Besides, you couldn't have
swallowed 'em. You'll find 'em somewheres."</p>

<p>"Maybe I couldn't have swallered 'em, but
I have," Grandmother mumbled. "What's
more, I feel 'em workin' now inside me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
They're chewing on the linin' of my stomach,
and it hurts."</p>

<div class="sidenote">What's
the
Matter?</div>

<p>"I didn't know there was any linin' in
your stomach."</p>

<p>"There is. It said so in the paper."</p>

<p>"Did it say anything about hooks and eyes
and whalebones? What kind of a linin' is
it&mdash;cambric, or drillin'?"</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can set there, Matilda,
and make fun of your poor old mother, when
she's bein' eaten alive by her own teeth. I
wouldn't treat a dog like that, much less my
own flesh and blood."</p>

<p>"I've never heard of dogs bein' et by their
own teeth," commented Matilda, missing the
point.</p>

<p>Ostentatiously lame, Grandmother limped
to the decrepit sofa and lay down with a groan.
Rosemary came in from the kitchen with the
oatmeal, and was about to go back for the
coffee when another groan arrested her
attention.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm dyin', Rosemary," Grandmother mumbled,
hoarsely. "I've swallered my teeth,
and I am dyin' in agony."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You couldn't have swallowed
your teeth!"</p>

<p>"That's what I told her," said Miss Matilda,
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"But I have," Grandmother retorted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
feebly. "I can feel 'em&mdash;here." She placed
her hand upon her ill-defined waist line, and
groaned again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rosemary
to the
Rescue</div>

<p>Rosemary ran up-stairs, inspired to unusual
speed by the heartrending sounds that came
from below. When she returned, Grandmother
seemed to be in a final spasm, and even Matilda
was frightened, though she would not have
admitted it.</p>

<p>"Here," said Rosemary. "Now come to
breakfast."</p>

<p>Grandmother rolled her eyes helplessly
toward Rosemary, then suddenly sat up.
"Where'd you get 'em?" she demanded, in a
different tone.</p>

<p>"They were on the floor under the washstand.
Please come before everything gets
cold."</p>

<p>"I told you you hadn't swallowed 'em,"
remarked Matilda, caustically.</p>

<p>"Maybe I didn't, but I might have,"
rejoined Grandmother. "Anyhow, I've seen
how you'd all act in case I had swallered
'em, and I know who to leave my money to
when I die." She beamed kindly upon
Rosemary, in whom the mention of money
had produced mingled emotions of anger and
resentment.</p>

<p>"If you had swallowed 'em, Rosemary
couldn't have got 'em," Matilda objected.</p>

<p>"She'd have tried," said the old lady,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
sharply, "and that's more than can be said
of some folks. Not mentionin' any names."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Bit of
Gossip</div>

<p>Breakfast bade fair to be a lively sparring
match when Rosemary interposed, pacifically:
"Never mind what might have been. Let's
be glad she didn't swallow them." As the
others accepted this compromise, the remainder
of the meal proceeded in comparative peace.</p>

<p>"I heard from the milkman this morning,"
said Matilda, "that Marshs' company has
gone."</p>

<p>"Gone!" repeated Grandmother. "What
for? I thought she had come to stay a spell."</p>

<p>"Gone!" echoed Rosemary, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Did she go sudden?" queried Grandmother.</p>

<p>"Well, in a way it was sudden, and in a
way 'twasn't. She was more'n a whole day
puttin' her clothes into her trunks&mdash;the respectable
trunk, and the big trunk, and the
dog-house, and the one what had bulges on all
sides but one."</p>

<p>"What train did she go on?"</p>

<p>"The eight o'clock accommodation, yesterday
morning. Young Marsh went down to
see her off, and the station agent told the
milkman that he stood lookin' after the train
until you couldn't even see the smoke from
the engine. The agent was restin' after havin'
helped hist the trunks on the train, and young
Marsh up and handed him out a dollar, without
even sayin' what it was for. He reckoned it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
was pay for stoppin' the train and helpin' to
put on the trunks, but the railroad pays him
for doin' that, so the milkman thinks it was
kind of a thank-offerin', on account of her
havin' stayed so long that they was glad to get
rid of her."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Tip</div>

<p>"'Twasn't no thank-offerin'," replied Grandmother,
shaking her head sagely. "That's
what they call a tip."</p>

<p>"The agent was some upset by it," Matilda
agreed. "He's been keepin' station here for
more'n ten years now and nobody ever did the
likes of that before."</p>

<p>"I didn't say it was an upsetment&mdash;I said
it was a tip."</p>

<p>"What's the difference?"</p>

<p>"A tip is money that you give somebody
who thinks he's done something for you,
whether you think he has or not."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," Matilda muttered.</p>

<p>"I didn't either, at first," Grandmother
admitted, "but I was readin' a piece in the
paper about women travellin' alone and it
said that 'in order to insure comfort, a tip
should be given for every slight service.'
Them's the very words."</p>

<p>"It means bowin', then," returned Matilda.
"Bowin' and sayin', 'Thank you.'"</p>

<p>"It's no such thing. Wait till I get the
paper."</p>

<p>After a prolonged search through the hoarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
treasures of the past three or four months,
Grandmother came back to her chair by the
window, adjusted her spectacles, and began
to read "The Lady Traveller by Land."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Lady's
Baggage</div>

<p>"'When it becomes necessary, for the sake
of either business or pleasure, for a lady to
start out upon a trip alone, no matter how
short, she should make all her preparations
well in advance, so that she need not be hurried
just before starting, and may embark
upon her journey with that peaceful and
contented mind which is so essential to the
true enjoyment of travelling.</p>

<p>"'She will, of course, travel with the smallest
amount of baggage compatible with comfort,
but a few small articles that should not be
overlooked will more than repay the slight
trouble caused by their transportation. Among
these may be mentioned the medicine chest,
in which are a few standard household remedies
for illness or accident, a bottle of smelling-salts,
another of cologne, and a roll of old
linen for bandages. While accident is not
at all likely, it is just as well to be prepared
for all emergencies.</p>

<p>"'The lady traveller will naturally carry
her own soap and towels, and also a silk or
cotton bag for her hat. She&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"A what for her hat?" asked Matilda, with
unmistakable interest.</p>

<p>"'A silk or cotton bag for her hat,'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Grandmother repeated. "'To keep the dust
out.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Hat-Bag</div>

<p>"What's the good of wearin' a hat if she's
got to set with a bag over it?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't say she's to wear the bag."</p>

<p>"Well, she's wearin' the hat, ain't she?
How's she to put the bag over the hat
while she's wearin' the hat without wearin'
the bag too? That's what I'd like to know."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's to put her hat into when she
takes it off for the night," Grandmother suggested,
hopefully, though she was not at all
sure. "A person ain't likely to get much sleep
in a hat."</p>

<p>"No, nor in a bag neither."</p>

<p>"'She should also carry her luncheon, as
the meals supplied to travellers are either poor
or expensive, or both. With a small spirit
lamp she can very easily make coffee or tea
for herself, or heat a cupful of milk should she
be restless in the night. Care should be taken,
however, not to set fire to the curtains surrounding
the berth in this latter emergency.'</p>

<p>"'The curtains surrounding the berth,'"
Grandmother repeated, in a wavering voice.
"It's printed wrong. They've got it b-e-r-t-h."</p>

<p>"Seems to me," murmured Matilda, "that
a woman who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Matilda!" interrupted Grandmother, imperiously.
For a moment the silence was
awkward. "Unmarried women ain't got any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
call to be thinkin' about such things, let alone
speakin' of 'em. This piece is written to
cover all possible emergencies of the lady
traveller, but it ain't for such as you to be
askin' questions about what don't concern
you."</p>

<div class="sidenote">In the
Morning</div>

<p>"Go ahead," said Matilda, submissively.</p>

<p>"Where was I? Oh, yes. 'The ladies'
dressing-room will always be found at one of
the two ends of the car. Care should be taken
early in the journey to ascertain which end.
If there are many ladies in the car, one should
rise early, to take advantage of the unoccupied
room for a cooling and refreshing sponge bath.
It will be necessary to carry a sponge for this,
and a small bag of rubber or oiled silk should
be made for it to prevent moistening the
contents of the suit-case after using.'"</p>

<p>"Supposin' they all subscribed for this
paper," Matilda objected, "and all should rise
early for the cooling and refreshing sponge
bath?"</p>

<p>"'Tain't likely," Grandmother answered.
"'After the bath one should take plenty of time
to dress, as nothing is less conducive to
comfort in travelling than the feeling that one
has been too hastily attired. By this time,
the porter will have the berth in order, if he
has been tipped the night before.'"</p>

<p>Matilda murmured inarticulately, but was
too wise to speak.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Porter</div>

<p>"'The usual tip,'" Grandmother continued,
hastily, with her cheeks burning, "'is twenty-five
cents for each person every twenty-four
hours. In order to insure comfort, a tip should
be given for every slight service, but nothing
smaller than five cents should ever be given
at any one time.</p>

<p>"'It has been said that a porter is a dark
gentleman who has been employed to keep
air out of the car, but the lady traveller will
find it easy to induce him to open a ventilator
or two if he has been properly tipped. Fresh
air is very essential for the true enjoyment of
travelling.</p>

<p>"'He can throw many little comforts in one's
way&mdash;a pillow during the daytime or an extra
blanket at night, or&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Matilda interrupted, "as
I'd care to have comforts or pillows or blankets
thrown at me, night or day, especially by a
man, no matter what colour he is."</p>

<p>"'Mindful always of the possibility of accident,'"
Grandmother resumed, "'it is well to
keep one's self as presentable as possible,
especially during the night, when according to
statistics the majority of wrecks occur. Consequently
the experienced lady traveller will
not undress entirely, but merely removing a
few of her outer garments, and keeping her
shoes within easy reach, she will don a comfortable
dressing-gown, and compose herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
for sleep. Some people prefer to have the
berth made up feet first, but it is always better
to have the head toward the engine, as experience
has proved that the slight motion of the
train assists the circulation, which should run
toward the feet if sleep is to be enjoyed during
the night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Where to
Eat</div>

<p>"'If, owing to circumstances, it is impossible
to carry a luncheon and one must either leave
the train for one's meals or go into the dining-car,
there are a few very simple rules to remember.
In case the meal is to be taken at a
wayside station, and, as often happens, there
is more than one eating-house which offers
refreshment, the lady traveller should wait
quietly by her own car until she sees into which
place the train officials go. Remember that
they have been over the road before and know
where the most comfortable and reasonable
meal is to be had.</p>

<p>"'Upon the other hand, if one goes into the
dining-car, the same rules apply as at any
well-regulated hotel. From the list of dishes
which will be offered her upon a printed card,
the lady traveller may select such as seem
attractive, and, in case of doubt, she may with
perfect propriety ask the waiter to make a
selection for her, as he has been placed there
by the company for that purpose.</p>

<p>"'Having eaten to her satisfaction, she will
carefully compare the check which is brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
her with the list of prices given upon the printed
card, add them up mentally without seeming to
do so, and if all is right, pay the bill, giving
to the waiter ten per cent of the total amount
for a tip. That is, if the check calls for one
dollar, the waiter will receive a dollar and ten
cents.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ten Per
Cent</div>

<p>"What for?" queried Matilda.</p>

<p>"That's his tip," explained the old lady.
"That's what I've been tellin' you all along."</p>

<p>"Does it cost ten dollars to go to the city?"</p>

<p>"Not as I know of. The fare used to be
four dollars and somethin'. Why?"</p>

<p>"Then why did young Marsh give the station
agent a dollar? That's what I want to know."</p>

<p>"You can't find out from me," Grandmother
answered, with all evidence of having told the
literal truth. "Shall I go on with this piece
I'm tryin' to read, or don't you want your
mind improved none?"</p>

<p>"I'm willing to have my mind improved, but
I'd like the privilege of askin' a question
occasionally while it's being done."</p>

<p>"Last week's paper said there was no way of
improvin' the mind that was to be compared
with readin'. Shall I go on?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;go on."</p>

<p>"'If the check calls for a dollar and a half,
the waiter will receive an extra fifteen cents
for his tip, and so on. In case of any disagreement,
always refer to the train officials, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
are usually courteous and well-mannered.
Should they not be so, however, a threat to
write to the President of the railroad will
usually be found all sufficient to produce a
change of demeanour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Avoid
Making
Acquaintances</div>

<p>"'The lady traveller should bear in mind the
fact that it is impossible to confine the pleasures
and privileges of travel to entirely reputable
persons, and should hence keep upon the safe
side by making no chance acquaintances,
whatever the provocation may be.</p>

<p>"'By wearing dark clothes, preferably her
old ones, an unassuming hat, and no jewelry,
the lady traveller may render herself inconspicuous
and not likely to attract masculine
attention. In case of accident it is allowable
to accept assistance from anyone, though the
train officials are at all times to be preferred.
If one desires to know what time it is, how
late the train is, how long the train will stop
at the next meal station, or when one is due
at one's destination, the train officials are the
ones to ask.</p>

<p>"'Upon a long and tedious journey, however,
or in case of many prolonged delays, it is
quite permissible to exchange a few words
upon the weather or some other topic of
mutual interest with a fellow-passenger of the
same sex, whether she be travelling alone, or
accompanied by her husband.</p>

<p>"'Pleasant acquaintances are sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
formed in this way, and it may be entirely
safe and proper, under certain circumstances,
to accept small courtesies from a gentleman
who is travelling with his wife, such as the
brief loan of a newspaper or magazine, or
information regarding the scenery through
which the train is passing when none of the
train officials are at hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At the
End of the
Journey</div>

<p>"'It is best, however, to be very careful,
for it is much easier not to begin friendly
relations with one's fellow passengers than
it is to discontinue such relations after they
have been once begun.</p>

<p>"'It is seldom necessary, or even advisable,
to give one's name to anyone except the
officials of the train, but there can be no objection
to showing a fellow-passenger of the same
sex one's name upon one's ticket if polite
relations have been established. This is better
than speaking the name aloud, which might
cause embarrassment if it were overheard,
and carries with it no such social obligation
as the exchange of cards would do.</p>

<p>"'Arriving at her destination, the lady
traveller should proceed at once to her hotel
or lodging-house, if no friend is to meet her,
regardless of the plans of her fellow passengers.
If one should chance to meet any of them
afterward, a courteous inclination of the head,
accompanied by a bright smile, is sufficient
recognition, or, if for any reason one prefers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
not to recognise those with whom one has
travelled, all that is necessary is to appear not
to see them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appeal to
the
Conductor</div>

<p>"'In case a gentleman should attempt to
converse with the lady traveller while the
train is in motion or at rest, this same conduct
meets the exigencies of the situation admirably:
simply do not appear to see him. If, however,
he continues to converse, turn to him, and
say in a low, well-controlled voice: "Sir, if
you persist further in forcing your unwelcome
attentions upon me, I shall summon the conductor
at once."</p>

<p>"'In most cases, the objectionable party will
at once leave and the interference of the conductor
will not be required.</p>

<p>"'The next article in this series will deal
with "The Lady Traveller by Water," where
conditions are entirely different and require
a different line of conduct.'"</p>

<p>"There," said Grandmother, clearing her
throat and folding up the paper. "I hope
you understand now what a tip is."</p>

<p>"It seems to be one tenth of all you've
got," observed Matilda, staring out of the
window, "like those religious sects that believes
in givin' a tenth of everything to the church."</p>

<p>"Travellin' must be terribly exciting,"
remarked Grandmother, pensively.</p>

<p>"So 'tis," Matilda agreed after a pause.
"I reckon it's better to stay at home."</p>

<h2 class="chaphead">The Weaving of the Tapestry</h2>


<div class="sidenote">A Bunch
of Grapes</div>

<p>Alden threw himself into his work with
feverish energy, instinctively relieving
his mind by wearying his body. All day he
toiled in the vineyard, returning at night
white-faced and exhausted, but content.</p>

<p>One morning when Madame came down to
breakfast, she found at her plate a single
bunch of grapes, wet with dew and still cool
with the chill of the night. She took it
up with an exclamation of pleasure, for never,
within her memory, had such grapes as these
come even from the Marsh vineyards.</p>

<p>She held the heavy cluster to the sunlight,
noting the perfect shape of the fruit, the purple
goblets filled with sweetness, and the fairy-like
bloom, more delicate even than the dust
on the butterfly's wing. Pride and thankfulness
filled her heart, for, to her, it was not only
their one source of income but a trust imposed
upon them by those who had laid out the
vineyard, and, more than all else, the standard
by which her son was to succeed or fail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Night
after
Night</div>

<p>The tribal sense was strong in Madame, last
though she was of a long and noble line.
Uninterruptedly the blood of the Marshs
had coursed through generation after generation,
carrying with it the high dower of
courage, of strength to do the allotted task
hopefully and well. And now&mdash;Madame's face
saddened, remembering Edith.</p>

<p>Since her one attempt to cross the silence
that lay like a two-edged sword between them,
Madame had said nothing to Alden. Nor
had he even mentioned Edith's name since
she went away, though his face, to the loving
eyes of his mother, bore its own message.</p>

<p>Night after night, when they sat in the
living-room after dinner, no word would be
spoken by either until bedtime, when Madame
would say "Good-night," and, in pity, slip
away, leaving him to follow when he chose.
Sometimes he would answer, but, more frequently,
he did not even hear his mother leave
the room. Yearning over him as only a
mother may, Madame would lie awake with
her door ajar, listening for his step upon the
stairs.</p>

<p>While the night waxed and waned, Alden
sat alone, his eyes fixed unalterably upon
Edith's empty chair, in which, by common
consent, neither of them sat. The soft outlines
of her figure seemed yet to lie upon the faded
tapestry; the high, carved back seemed still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
to bear the remembered splendour of her
beautiful head.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Balm for
Alden</div>

<p>After Madame had gone, Alden would sometimes
light the candle that stood upon the
piano, mute now save for the fingers of Memory.
Moving the bench out a little and turning it
slightly toward the end of the room, he would
go back to his own far corner, where he used
to sit while Edith played.</p>

<p>Conjuring her gracious image out of the
dreamy shadows, he found balm for his sore
heart in the white gown that fell softly around
her, the small white foot that now and then
pressed the pedal, the long, graceful line that
swept from her shoulder to her finger-tips, the
faint hollow where her gown, with the softness
of a caress, melted into the ivory whiteness
of her neck, the thick, creamy skin, in some
way suggesting white rose-leaves, the scarlet,
wistful mouth, the deep brown eyes reflecting
golden lights, and the crown of wonderful
hair that shimmered and shone and gleamed
like burnished gold.</p>

<p>The subtle sweetness of her filled the room.
She had left behind her not only a memory
but the enduring impress of personality.
The house was full of Ediths. There was one
at the table, another at the piano, one leaning
against the mantel with hands clasped behind
her, another in a high-backed rocker, leaning
back against a dull green cushion, and one upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the stairway, ascending with light steps that
died away with the closing of a door, or descending
with a quick rustle of silken skirts
that presently merged into perfume, then into
her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Release
from Pain</div>

<p>Every gown she had worn, every word she
had said, every laugh that had wakened
slumbering echoes with its low, vibrant contralto,
came remorselessly back. Full tides of
longing beat pitilessly upon his senses, never,
it seemed, to ebb again. And yet, at times,
when his whole soul so cried out for her that
he stretched his arms, in yearning, toward the
myriad phantom Ediths that peopled the
room, mystical assurance would come from
somewhere that she, too, was keeping the
night watch.</p>

<p>Through the tense and throbbing darkness,
love sped from one to the other as though upon
ghostly wings. Neither sight nor sound nor
touch betrayed its coming, yet the call and the
answer were always divinely sure. As though
they two stood dumbly on either side of some
mysterious portal, denied all things save
longing, heart-beat answered unto heart-beat
in the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>The experience invariably brought comfort
and a certain release from pain. Denial seemed
to be but another phase of fulfilment, since
it opened the way for this exquisite belonging
of one to the other. Beyond and above all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
lure of woman, wholly aside from the ecstasy
of sight and touch, she was his as inseparably
as perfume belongs to the rose that breathes
it forth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Toiling in
the
Vineyard</div>

<p>While he worked in the vineyard it was
consciously for her. For her sake he aspired
to make the best of himself; to make this hillside
yield its purple banners from the secret
storehouses within. So he had struggled with
soil and season, with suns that scorched and
winds that chilled, with parching days that
opened the earth in great crevices, and with
torrents that made the paths between the vines
impassable for days.</p>

<p>From the wide windows that overlooked the
valley, Madame watched the vineyard with an
anxious heart. She, too, had toiled as far as
a woman might, in the years that elapsed
between the death of her husband and the
maturity of her son. Sometimes all the powers
and purposes of Nature had apparently been
arrayed against her, and, again, as at the
touch of a magic wand, the earth had yielded
up its fruit.</p>

<p>Yet she had never lost her courage. Knowing
that the logical strength of position lies
nearly always with the pursuer, she would
never own herself beaten, though there was a
time of terror when the crop failed for three
successive years.</p>

<p>Now the tapestry lay before her, well on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
its way to completion. She had watched the
great web spread upon the hillside, year by
year, from snow to snow again. Surrounding
it on three sides, like the frame upon which it
was stretched, were the stalwart pines that
protected it from the icy winds. Below, like a
silver ribbon, the river irregularly bounded
it, a shining line of demarcation between the
valley and the opposite hills.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Coming of
Spring</div>

<p>When the snows were deep, there were only
gentle undulations to mark the covered vines.
Even the pines bent low with it, as though
hoary with their weight of years. When the
snows melted, tiny crystal rivulets ran down
the tapestry, into the silver ribbon that was
stretched across the foot, and upon a neutral
background of earth the black, tangled
threads showed dimly.</p>

<p>In a night, almost, there would come a
change. Where the threads had lain hopelessly
matted, appeared some semblance of
order, as though the Weaver had come. Then,
as they became separate groups, a faint glow
of green dawned above them, not so much
colour as the promise of colour, not so much
design as the planning of it.</p>

<p>Through and through the web, like the
Weaver's shuttle, figures moved from one
tangle of threads to another, setting all straight
as they went. Swiftly then the colour came,
green upon the black, with the neutral earth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
filling the background, gradually to be covered
save for the long regular lines that stretched
from East to West, from North to South.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The New
Growth</div>

<p>All the beauty of Spring and Summer went
to the making of the tapestry: the first robin's
cheery call, the shimmer of blue wings speeding
across it, the golden glow from an oriole's
breast, and the silver rain of melody dripping
from the throat of a meadow-lark as he swept
through the infinite spaces above.</p>

<p>Up into the threads came the thousand
stored sweetnesses of the earth, aspiring surely
upward through devious, winding ways. The
softness of leaves that had gone back to dust,
the wine from fallen grapes that had dripped
through the sand into the dark storehouse
beneath, were only to be taken up again, for
sap or fibre or bloom.</p>

<p>Blown perfumes came from distant orchards,
mysteriously to become a part of the tapestry.
Purple dawns and prismatic sunsets, crystalline
noons and starry midnights slowly but surely
were woven in. The new leaves shone afar,
surrounding the vineyard with a faint, iridescent
sheen through which tiny wings moved
ceaselessly with a far-off, sleepy sound.</p>

<p>Weary winds came to the vineyard, and,
for the moment, lay at peace upon the web,
drinking the exquisite fragrance of leaf and
blossom. Then, rising slowly, as though still
intoxicated with that more than mortal sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>ness,
they bore it afar to the four corners of
the earth. Some of it sank into the valley,
and the river turned in its sleep to dimple with
smiles, ripple with silvery laughter, and drop
to sleep again. The scent of it rose to the
hills, like heavenly incense from earthly altars,
and the Little People in feathers and fur
breathed deeply of it and were glad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Ripening
of the
Grapes</div>

<p>Wild bees hummed through the web, and
left it, heavy laden with the sweet essence
distilled from the dust by the subtle chemistry
of sun and rain. And the Weaver only smiled
at the golden-winged army of plunderers, for
secretly they ministered unto the vineyard in
ways of love.</p>

<p>Then the Weaver paused to rest, for the pattern
was made and there was only the colour
to be put in. The fragrance died, the blossoms
fell, and the miracle of the tapestry began.
Where there had been scent, came substance;
where there had been promise, came fulfilment.</p>

<p>With a single mighty impulse the vines took
deep hold of the treasure in the storehouse
beneath, spending it prodigally for sap to be
poured into these waiting goblets of emerald
and pearl. All the hoarded strength of
leaf and tendril was caught up by the current,
and swept blindly onward to its fruitful
destiny.</p>

<p>And so the first faint hints of purple came
into the tapestry, to spread and deepen and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
divide and spread again until, in certain lights,
the vineyard lay transfigured in an amethystine
glow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Gathering
of the
Fruit</div>

<p>Shaded by the leaves that had begun to
wither, held by tendrils that were strained
until they could hold no more, the purple
chalices swung lazily in the golden light, slowly
filling with the garnered sweetness that every
moment brought. Night and day the alchemy
went on&mdash;dust and sun and dreaming, dust
and moon and dreaming, while the Weaver
waited, dreaming too, until the web should be
complete.</p>

<p>When the signal was given for the tapestry
to be taken from the loom, the Weaver crept
away, for he could do no more. Figures
thronged upon the hillside, gaily coloured
garments appeared here and there in the web,
and a medley of soft foreign voices rose where
for long there had been no sound.</p>

<p>From side to side of the web the workers
moved, always bearing armfuls of purple, to
the frame of pines and beyond it. And so the
tapestry faded, day by day, and the vines
died, and great bare spaces were left upon the
background where the neutral earth showed
through.</p>

<p>Steadily among them moved one stately
figure&mdash;a tall young man with big brown eyes
and a boyish mouth. From early morning
until dusk his voice could be heard, issuing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
directions, hurrying the laggards, and bidding
others to go back and work more slowly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">After
the Day's
Work</div>

<p>Creaking through the valley, on the tawny
road that lay below the tapestry, went, each
night, waggons heavily laden with baskets
packed into crates. Far beyond the frame
of pines was a small group of houses, whither
the workers went with their armfuls of purple,
returning presently to despoil the hillside
further.</p>

<p>At dusk, when the day's work was over,
the smoke of camp-fires rose against the afterglow,
and brooded over the vineyard in a
faint haze like its lost bloom. The scent of
grapes mingled with the pungent odour of
burning pine, and broken chalices upon the
ground were trod into purple stains, as of
blood. Tales of love and war went from
camp-fire to camp-fire, and fabulous stories
were told of the yield of other vineyards in
the same valley.</p>

<p>Finally the last grapes were gathered, the
last baskets packed and crated, and along the
road the laden waggons creaked for the last
time. Then the young man gave a great feast
for the workers, lasting from noon until
midnight, with pitchers of cider, great loaves
of freshly baked bread and cake, roasted fowls,
hot baked potatoes, and pink hams, crusted
with crumbs and cloves and sugar, that fell
into flakes at the touch of the knife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Veil
of
Beauty</div>

<p>The same waggons that had carried the grapes
now took the workers to the train. The young
man who had paid them their wages accompanied
them, and, at the station, there was a
great medley of farewells spoken in five or six
different tongues. When the last shriek of
the engine had died away and the roar of the
train was lost in the distance, the young man
drew a long breath of relief and went home.</p>

<p>A deadly silence reigned upon the hillside
where the torn web lay, its bloom and beauty
all gone. Ragged bits of green, mingled with
dull brown tracery of vine and tendril, lay
back upon the background of earth, but of
purple there was no trace. In the hush of
the night, the Weaver came back, to muse sadly
over what had been and, perhaps, to dream of
what yet might be.</p>

<p>There was chance of no more weaving, for the
threads were broken and the time was short,
but the rack and ruin were pitiful to see. So,
from hidden places no man may guess, the
Weaver summoned the Secret Spinners, bidding
them lay a veil upon the vineyard.</p>

<p>Swiftly there came forth a miracle of beauty.
Fairy lace and impalpable mysteries of chiffon
were laid upon the hillside, spreading from
vine to vine. Sometimes a single slender
thread, impearled with dewdrops, bridged the
distance from one tendril to another, again a
bit of cobweb was spread over a dead leaf,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
to catch a hint of iridescence from the sun or
moon; and now and then a shimmering length
of ghostly fabric was set in place at dusk, to
hold the starry lights that came to shine
upon the broken tapestry with the peace of
benediction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Content at
Last</div>

<p>Along the well-trodden ways Alden went,
tired, but content, having come at last to the
knowledge of himself. Already he was planning
to enlarge the vineyard next year, and
to try another variety of grapes upon the new
ground. He considered one plan to hurry the
packing, another to hasten the crop, and
studied the problem of housing the workers
from their standpoint, not from his.</p>

<p>For the first time he was thinking of his
work as something other than a necessary
evil. It had become, in a sense, a means of
grace, for he had discovered that the spirit
in which one earns his daily bread means as
much to his soul as the bread itself may mean
to his body.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The light from the low reading-lamp lay
softly upon Madame's silvered hair, as she
bent over her bit of fancy work, silent, as
usual, since the spell of Edith's presence had
come into the house. Alden was not even
pretending to read the paper&mdash;he sat staring
into the shadows before him at Edith's empty
chair, but, as he looked, he smiled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Goal
Reached</div>

<p>With a little lump in her throat Madame
bent over her work again, having looked up to
thread her needle, and having seen his face.
For a moment she waited, hoping for a confidence,
but there was none.</p>

<p>Alden took a letter from his pocket and
tossed it into her lap. It announced the sale
of the crop at a larger price than ever before,
and requested the first chance upon the yield
of the following year.</p>

<p>Madame folded it up and gave it back to
him, then their eyes met.</p>

<p>Young and strong and hopeful, radiating
the consciousness of good work well done, her
son smiled back at her. Her face illumined
with joy.</p>

<p>"Master of the vineyard at last, my son?"
she said.</p>

<p>He rose from his chair, bent over, and kissed
her fondly. "Yes, Mother, thanks to you&mdash;and
Edith." Then he added, after a pause:
"Master of myself, too."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alden
Writes to
Edith</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Heart's Dearest</span>:</p>

<p>It was two months ago to-day that you
went away, and to me it has been eternity.
Every day and every hour I think of you, sometimes
with such intense longing that it seems
as though the air before me must take shape
and yield you to my arms.</p>

<p>"I have been working hard, and&mdash;no, I
will not say 'trying to forget,' since memory,
upon the dull background of my commonplace
existence has set one great blazing star. I
would not, if I could choose, go back to one
hour that did not hold you, but rather would I
pray for Time to stand still for us at any one
of his jewelled moments upon the dial, when
you and I were heart to heart.</p>

<p>"Mysteriously you have made everything
right for me, denied all things though we are.
After ten years of struggle with the vineyard,
with several conspicuous failures and now and
then a half-hearted success, I have at last
rejoiced Mother's heart&mdash;and my own as well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>&mdash;with
the largest crop within my memory or
hers. The fruit, too, has been finer than ever
before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drudgery</div>

<p>"The school, also, which I have hated ever
since I had it, begins to appear before me in a
new light. It is not only those dull and stupid
children who are to learn lessons in that one-roomed
schoolhouse&mdash;it is I. While they
struggle with the alphabet and multiplication-table
and the spelling of words in four syllables,
their teacher has before him invaluable opportunities
to acquire patience, self-control, and a
sense of justice, if not to inspire affection.</p>

<p>"Before, I went my way in sullen discontent.
Because I could not do the things I
wanted to do, I disdained the humble tasks
assigned me, forgetting that in the great
scheme of things each one of us has his work.
Some of us must scrub floors, others carry
bricks or mortar, and others must grow grapes
and teach school.</p>

<p>"I had thought, in my blindness, that the
great things were the easiest to do, but now I
see that drudgery is an inseparable part of
everything worth while, and the more worth
while it is, the more drudgery is involved.</p>

<p>"In years gone by I have given time to the
vineyard, but nothing at all of myself. I
held myself aloof and apart while Duty, like a
stern taskmaster, urged me to the things I
hated, merely to please Mother, who had done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
so much for me that she had the right to
demand this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No Longer
Apart</div>

<p>"This year I have put my heart into my
work. When failure seemed imminent, I
have laboured with fresh courage. I have
remembered, too, that the tools with which I
worked were human beings like myself, and
not so many mere machines.</p>

<p>"My love for you has been the magic key
that has unlocked the doors dividing me from
my fellow-men. No longer isolated, no longer
apart, I am one of a brotherhood that claims
fellowship with all humanity. One blood flows
uninterruptedly through us all, one heart
beats in us all, and, truly seen, we are not
separate individuals, but only component
parts of the Greater Self.</p>

<p>"Once I was absorbed in myself. Now I
yearn unspeakably toward all with whom
I come in contact. I see a thousand ways in
which I may be kind. It is not for me to
preach the gospel of love and understanding,
but to live it, and, in living it, either to lead or
to follow, as may be right and best.</p>

<p>"Hitherto I have kept away from the
workers in the vineyard as much as I possibly
could. Some of them have come for five
years in succession, and I neither remembered
their faces nor knew their names. Now, not
because I felt that it was my duty, but because
I really wanted to, I have tried to come a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
little closer, to see into their lives as best I
might.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Humble
Toilers</div>

<p>"I have seen before me such dramas of
suffering and love as have made me ashamed,
more than once, of my own worthless life and
my own vain repinings. These humble toilers
in my vineyard had come nearer the truth of
things than I had, and were happier. Night
after night I have been glad of the shelter of
the darkness and have moved back out of the
circle of light made by the camp-fire, that none
of them might see my face.</p>

<p>"One woman, too weak and ill to work,
would lie down among the vines to rest, while
her husband filled her basket from his own.
They needed money for a crippled child who
could be made right by an expensive operation.
One night I saw a lantern moving back and
forth among the vines, and when I went out to
investigate, the man was hard at work, filling
basket after basket, because he knew that it
was not right to draw two people's pay without
doing two people's work.</p>

<p>"He had done this every night, and sometimes,
too, the woman had spent her limited
strength labouring beside him. Both were
nearly heartbroken, having figured up that, at
the rate the work was being done, they would
still be twenty dollars short of the desired sum.
So I gave them this, and they are to return it
when they can. If it is not possible to return<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
it earlier, they are to come next year and work
it out. I have no fear that they will not come,
but, even should they fail me, I would rather
lose the money and have my trust betrayed,
than to miss a chance of helping where I might.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Feast
for the
Workers</div>

<p>"One man had been saving for years that
he might send to Italy for his wife and children.
His earnings would give him a little more than
the amount he needed, and he was counting
the days until he could put his plan into execution.
He could neither read nor write, so,
one night, by the camp-fire, I wrote his letter
for him, in my best schoolmaster's hand, for
the first time finding my scanty knowledge
of Italian of some real use.</p>

<p>"We have always given them a feast when
the work was over, and sent some trifling
presents to the wives and children who had
remained behind. This was for our own
sake, however, and not in any sense for theirs.
It has been hard to get people to come, and
we wanted to offer inducements.</p>

<p>"This time I sat at the head of the table
myself. We had songs and stories and much
good cheer. Afterward, when I said good-night,
they all came to shake hands with me
and say 'Thank you.' It was the first time.</p>

<p>"One man who lives in a crowded district
in the city, has a wife who has tuberculosis.
The remainder of the family consists of a
daughter of fourteen and a boy of nine. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
is to come back and bring them with him.
They are to have the best of the workers'
houses, on the pine hill above the vineyard.
On a cot, in the clean cold air, the mother will
get well again if it is possible for her to get well.
I have work enough around the place for the
man, the boy can go to school, and the Lady
Mother will train the daughter in the ways of
housewifery. In the evenings I shall teach
her to read and write.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Passing
On</div>

<p>"We have swept our attic clean of things we
had stored away. We have given not only
what we do not need, but what we can do
without. This winter, when the North wind
howls down the chimney, while I am sheltered
and warm, it will afford me satisfaction to know
that my useless garments are, at last, doing
good service somewhere.</p>

<p>"Mother, too, has caught the spirit of it.
I cannot tell you of the countless things she
has sent away&mdash;bedding, clothes, shoes, furniture,
food&mdash;everything. I do not know why
the workers' shacks around the vineyard should
remain idle practically all the time&mdash;there
must be others in damp cellars in that crowded
city who have become diseased, and who could
be healed by the pure cold air up among my
ancestral pines. I will see what can be done.</p>

<p>"These people who come to my vineyard
are, as it were, the connecting link between
me and the outer world. I had thought there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
was nothing for me to do here, and behold,
there is so much to be done that I scarcely
know where to begin. And this work has
been at my very door, as it were, for ten years,
and I have not seen it. Next year, I think
I shall have a night school for two hours
each evening after work. Many of them are
pathetically eager to learn and have no opportunity
to do so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Strange
Dream</div>

<p>"The night the workers all went back to the
city, I had a strange dream which now seems
significant. I thought I was in a great factory,
somewhere, that was given over to the weaving
of cloth. It was well equipped, there were
innumerable orders waiting to be filled, and
there were plenty of people to work, but
nothing was being done.</p>

<p>"The floor was covered with rubbish, the
windows were thick with dust and cobwebs;
where there were artificial lights they were
flickering disagreeably because they were
choked with dirt; the machinery creaked
abominably, and the air of the place was foul
beyond description. Meanwhile orders accumulated,
but the people stood around and
complained. Some of them were gathered in
groups, arguing; others sat on dusty benches,
singly or by twos, with discontented, unhappy
faces. Some were angry, and others only
hopeless, staring straight ahead, with eyes
that did not see.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">No One
Satisfied</div>

<p>"It seemed that no one was satisfied with
his lot, and each was eager to change with
someone else, who also wanted to change, but
not with him. The women whose duty it was
to scrub floors wanted to work at the looms,
but those at the looms aspired to the big airy
room where the bolts of cloth were measured
and rolled up.</p>

<p>"The men who had been told to wash
windows wanted to make patterns, the man in
charge of the ventilating apparatus wanted to
work in the office, and the man who was in
charge of the office, weary and jaded beyond all
power of words to portray, wanted a place at
the loom and a pay-envelope every Saturday
night instead of a commission upon his sales.</p>

<p>"Those who were supposed to weave blue
cloth with white dots upon it wanted to make
white cloth with blue dots upon it, but, it
seemed, there was no market for the white
cloth with the blue dots and they could not be
made to understand it.</p>

<p>"The boy who attended to the door of the
factory wanted to keep books in the office; the
men who were supposed to work in the shipping
room wanted to cut out the samples that
were sent to different firms to order from.
The girls who wrote letters and filed the correspondence
wanted to draw designs for new
patterns&mdash;oh, a great many wanted to draw
designs!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Spirit of
Love</div>

<p>"The man who did the designing was complaining
of a headache, and wanted to be
doorkeeper, that he might have plenty of
fresh air. The man who was supposed to oil
the machinery wanted to wash the windows&mdash;he
said it was a cleaner job; and the messengers
were tired of going back and forth all day&mdash;they
wanted to sit quietly and write letters.</p>

<p>"Suddenly an imperious voice called out:
'Each to his own work!' They hesitated for
a moment, then obeyed, and presently everything
was changed. From confusion and
disorder it resolved itself into perfect harmony,
for each one was doing his own work
and doing it well.</p>

<p>"And, as they worked, the Spirit of Love
came among them and the workers began to
sing at their tasks. Each one did not only
his own work but helped his neighbour with
his. They became eager to do all they could
instead of as little as they might and still
escape censure, and the face of each one was
shining with joy.</p>

<p>"When I awoke I was saying aloud: 'Each
to his own work!' For some time I did not
know it was only a dream, but gradually the
meaning of it became clear. Edith, did you
ever stop to think that the millennium could
be brought about in less than one hour, if
each did his own work well and in a spirit of
love? It is we ourselves who are out of har<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>mony,
not things as they are, and, having once
attained harmony, everything will become
right.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joy
through
Service</div>

<p>"And so, beloved, my love for you has been
as a great light in my soul. I need no more
than to give it without ceasing, and to renew,
through human service, not only my love
for you, but the love for all which leads to
brotherhood.</p>

<p>"I have come to see that joy comes through
what we give, not through what we take; happiness
through serving, not through being served;
and peace through labour, not rest.</p>

<p>"I thought, at first, that I loved you, but it
seems to have grown a hundred-fold. No
barriers may divide us from one another, nor
earth with all its seas sunder us apart, for
through love has come union, not only with
you but the whole world.</p>

<p>"And so, good-night&mdash;heart of my heart,
life of my life, and soul of my soul.</p>

<p style="margin-left:50%;">"A. M."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear and Ever Dearer</span>:</p>

<p>"Your letter lies against my heart where
I feel it with every rising breath. I, too,
have longed for you, a thousand times, and
in a thousand ways.</p>

<p>"Always as the tide of the night turns, I
wake and think of you. When through the
darkness comes no response, I smile to myself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
knowing you are asleep, then I sleep also. But
sometimes, in an instant, the darkness becomes
alive and throbs with eager messages, as love
surges from my heart to yours and from yours
to mine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Open
Door</div>

<p>"I, too, have come into the way of service, of
brotherhood. It may seem a strange thing to
write, or even to say, but you, who have never
failed to understand me, will understand this.
I never cared so much for my husband as I do
now; I was never less conscious of myself,
never more eager to ask nothing and give all.
And, through this change in me has come about
a change in him. Instead of each of us selfishly
demanding what we conceive to be
our 'rights,' each strives unselfishly to please
the other&mdash;to see who can give the most.</p>

<p>"You have taken nothing away that belongs
to anyone else, dear&mdash;the love I bear you is
yours alone, but, through it, I have some way
more to give; he is the richer, because of you.</p>

<p>"Like you, I have seen before me a multitude
of openings, all leading, through ways of
self-sacrifice, to the sure finding of one's self.
The more love you give, the more you have;
it is, in a way, like the old legend of the man
who found he could take to Heaven with him
only those things which he had given away.</p>

<p>"All around me I see the pitiful mistakes
that masquerade as marriage&mdash;women who
have no virtues save one tied like millstones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
to some of earth's noblemen; great-hearted
and great-souled women mated with clods.
I see people insanely jealous of one another,
suspicious, fault-finding, malicious; covertly
sending barbed shafts to one another through
the medium of general conversation. As if
love were ever to be held captive, or be won by
cords and chains! As if the freest thing on
earth would for a moment enter into bondage,
or minister unto selfishness when it is, of
itself, unselfishness! Passion-slaved and self-bound,
they never see beyond their own horizon,
nor guess that the great truths of life
and love lie just beyond their reach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Plea
for
Rosemary</div>

<p>"Looking back, I can see one thing that
you may have missed. This love of ours has
brought joy to you and to me, and, indirectly,
happiness to my husband. It has not affected
your mother, one way or another, but it has
hurt Rosemary&mdash;taken away from her the one
thing that made her sordid life worth while.</p>

<p>"Dear, can't you see your way clear to make
it right with her&mdash;to give back at least as
much as she had before I came into your life?
You will take nothing from me by doing so,
for my place with you is secure and beyond the
reach of change, as you know yours is with
me.</p>

<p>"But, just because the full moon has risen
upon midnight, shall we refuse to look at the
stars? Believe me, all the lesser loves have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
their rightful place, which should be more
definitely assured because of the greater light.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rosemary's
Need</div>

<p>"I am pleading not only for her, but for
you. Tell her everything, if you choose, or if
you feel that you must in order to be honest.
I am sure you can make her understand.</p>

<p>"The door of the House of Life is open for
you and for me, but it is closed against her.
It is in your power at least to set it ajar for
her; to admit her, too, into full fellowship
through striving and through love.</p>

<p>"She will help you with your vineyard
people, and, perhaps, come to peace that way.
Her unhappy face as I saw it last haunts me&mdash;I
cannot help feeling that I am in some way
responsible. She needs you and what you can
give her, more, perhaps, than I, who shall
never have it again.</p>

<p>"Never! The word, as I write it, tolls
through my consciousness like a funeral knell.
Never to see your face again, or to touch your
hand, or to hear you say you love me. Never
to feel your arms holding me close, your heart
beating against mine, never to thrill with
ecstasy in every fibre of me in answer to your
kiss.</p>

<p>"Only the silence, broken, perhaps, by an
occasional letter, and the call in the night,
bridging the darkness and distance between
us, to be answered for one little hour by love,
surging from one to the other and back again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Caught in
a Web</div>

<p>"And yet these thoughts of ours are as
a weaver's shuttle, plying endlessly through
the web of night and space and time. One
thought may make a slender thread, indeed,
but what of the countless thoughts that fly
back and forth, weaving and interweaving
as they go? Shall they not make first a
thread, and then a cord, then a web, and then
a fabric, until, at last, there is no separation,
but that of the body, which counts for
naught?</p>

<p>"Dear Heart, you mean so much to me, are
so much. From you and from your love for
me I take fresh courage every day. From your
strength I make sure of my own strength, from
your tenderness I gather compassion, and from
your steadfastness I gain the hope that leads
me onward, the belief that enables me to face
each day bravely and with a smile.</p>

<p>"Deep in my heart, I hold fast to one great
joy. Sometimes I close the door quickly upon
it and bar up the passage, lest anyone should
guess that there, within a bare white chamber,
is erected the high altar of my soul, where the
lights shine far into the shadows, in spite of
rock-hewn portals, closed and barred.</p>

<p>"The knowledge of your love I have with
me always, to steady me, to guide me, to
uplift me, to make even a grave warm and
sweet. And to you, with my own hands, I
have brought the divine fire that shall not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
fail, so what more need we ask of God, save
that somewhere, sometime, in His infinite
compassion, we may be together, even though
it may be in the House not Made with
Hands?</p>

<h2 class="chaphead">Betrothal</h2>


<div class="sidenote">On the
Hills by
the
Vineyard</div>

<p>Desolation lay upon the vineyard. The
fairy lace had been rudely torn aside
by invading storms and the Secret Spinners had
entered upon their long sleep. The dead
leaves rustled back and forth, shivering with
the cold, when the winds came down upon the
river from the hill. Caught, now and then,
upon some whirling gust, the leaves were
blown to the surface of the river itself, and,
like scuttled craft, swept hastily to ports
unknown.</p>

<p>Rosemary escaped from the house early in
the afternoon. Unable to go to the Hill of
the Muses, or up the river-road, she had taken
a long, roundabout path around the outskirts
of the village and so reached the hills back
of the vineyard. The air of the valley seemed
to suffocate her; she longed to climb to the
silent places, where the four winds of heaven
kept tryst.</p>

<p>She was alone, as always. She sighed as she
remembered how lonely she had been all her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
life. Except Alden, there had never been
anyone to whom she could talk freely. Even
at school, the other children had, by common
consent, avoided the solitary, silent
child who sat apart, always, in brown gingham
or brown alpaca, and taking refuge in
the fierce pride that often shields an abnormal
sensitiveness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In Real
Life</div>

<p>She sat down upon the cold, damp earth
and leaned against a tree, wondering if it
would not be possible for her to take cold and
die. In the books, people died when they
wanted to, or, what was more to the point,
when other people wanted them to. It was
wonderful, when you came to think of it,
how Death invariably aided Art.</p>

<p>But, in real life, things were pitifully different.
People who ought not to die did so, and
those who could well be spared clung to mortal
existence as though they had drunk deeply of
the fabled fountain of immortal youth.</p>

<p>Descending to personalities, Rosemary reflected
upon the ironical Fate that had taken
her father and mother away from her, and
spared Grandmother and Aunt Matilda. Or,
if she could have gone with her father and
mother, it would have been all right&mdash;Rosemary
had no deep longing for life considered
simply as existence. Bitterness and the passion
of revolt swayed her for the moment,
though she knew that the mood would pass,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
as it always did, when she took her soul into
the sanctuary of the hills.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A
Mystery</div>

<p>Dispassionately she observed her feet,
stretched out in front of her, and compared
them with Mrs. Lee's. Rosemary's shoes were
heavy and coarse, they had low, broad heels
and had been patched and mended until the
village cobbler had proclaimed himself at the
end of his resources. Once or twice she had
said, half-fearfully, that she needed new shoes,
but Grandmother had not seemed to hear.</p>

<p>Father had meant for her to have everything
she wanted&mdash;he had said so, in the letter which
at that moment lay against Rosemary's bitter
young heart. He would have given her a pair
of slippers like those Mrs. Lee had worn the
day she went there to tea&mdash;black satin, with
high heels and thin soles, cunningly embroidered
with tiny steel beads. How small and
soft the foot had seemed above the slipper;
how subtly the flesh had gleamed through the
fine black silk stocking!</p>

<p>She wondered whether father knew. No,
probably not, for if he did, he would find some
way to come and have it out with Grandmother&mdash;she
was sure of that. God knew, of course&mdash;God
knew everything, but why had He allowed
Grandmother to do it? It was an inscrutable
mystery to her that a Being with infinite
power should allow things to go wrong.</p>

<p>For the moment Rosemary's faith wavered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
then re-asserted itself. It was she who did
not understand: the ways of the Everlasting
were not her ways, and, moreover, they were
beyond her finite comprehension. If she
waited, and trusted, and meanwhile did the
best she could, everything would be right
somewhere, sometime. That must be what
Heaven was, a place where things were always
right for everybody.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Startled</div>

<p>Gradually her resentment passed away.
The impassioned yearning for life, in all its
fulness, that once had shaken her to the depths
of her soul, had ceased to trouble or to beckon.
It had become merely a question of getting
through with this as creditably and easily
as she might, and passing on to the next,
whatever that might prove to be.</p>

<p>The ground upon which she sat was cold
and damp. Rosemary shivered a little and
was glad. Release might come in that way,
though she doubted it. She was too hopelessly
healthy ever to take cold, and in all her
five and twenty years had never had a day's
illness.</p>

<p>A step beside her startled her and a kindly
voice said: "Why, Rosemary! You'll take
cold!"</p>

<p>Crimson with embarrassment she sprang to
her feet, shaking the soil from her skirts.
"I&mdash;I didn't hear you coming," she stammered.
"I must go."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">New
Plans</div>

<p>"Please don't," Alden responded. "Remember
how long it is since I've seen you.
How did you happen to come up here?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;oh, I don't know! I've come
sometimes to see the vineyard. I've&mdash;I've
liked to watch the people at work," she concluded,
lamely. "I see so few people, you
know."</p>

<p>Alden's face softened with vague tenderness.
"Was it just this last Summer you've been
coming, or has it been all along?"</p>

<p>"I've always come&mdash;ever since I was big
enough to climb the hill. I&mdash;I used to steal
grapes sometimes," she confessed, "before
I knew it was wrong."</p>

<p>"You can have all the grapes you want,"
he laughed. "I'll send you a basket every
day, if you want them, as long as the season
lasts. Why didn't you tell me before?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I never thought," she answered. She
might have added that she was not accustomed
to the idea of any sort of gift, but she did not
put the thought into words.</p>

<p>"Come over here, Rosemary. I want to
show you something&mdash;tell you about some new
plans of mine."</p>

<p>He led her to the group of workers' houses
back of the pines. A great deal of repairing
had been done and every house was habitable,
if not actually comfortable. They had all
been furnished with quiet good taste, and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
been freshly whitewashed, both inside and
out. There was a great pile of cots and a
stack of new blankets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Hospital</div>

<p>"What is it?" asked Rosemary, much interested.</p>

<p>"The Marsh Tuberculosis Hospital," he
answered. His face was beaming.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Don't you? Well, it's simple enough.
If I hadn't been all kinds of an idiot and
blindly selfish I'd have thought of it before.
One of the men who came to pick grapes this
year has a wife at home with tuberculosis.
All she needs is to lie on a cot outdoors and
have plenty of fresh eggs and milk. He's
coming to-morrow, with her, and his two children.
The girl will learn housekeeping from
mother daytimes and the boy will go to school.
I have room for several others if I can find
them, and I have people in town hunting
them up for me. See?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Rosemary. "How beautiful!
How good you are!"</p>

<p>"Not good," said Alden, shamefacedly,
digging at the soil with his heel. "Merely
decent&mdash;that's all." He took a spring cot
out of the pile, spread a blanket upon it, and
invited Rosemary to sit down.</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," she insisted, "no matter
what you say. How lovely it must be to be
able to do things for people&mdash;to give them what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
they need! Oh," she breathed, "if I could
only help!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Gift
and the
Giver</div>

<p>Alden looked at her keenly. "You can,
Rosemary."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but there's always a way,
if one wants to help."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to give," she murmured.
"I haven't anything of my own but my
mother's watch, and that won't go, so it
wouldn't be of any use to anybody."</p>

<p>"Someone said once," he continued, "that
'the gift without the giver is bare.' That
means that what you give doesn't count
unless you also give yourself."</p>

<p>"To give yourself,'" she repeated; then, all
at once, her face illumined. "I see now!" she
cried. "I can give myself! They'll need
someone to take care of them, and I can do
that. I can cook and scrub floors and keep
everything clean, and&mdash;but Grandmother
won't let me," she concluded, sadly.</p>

<p>A paragraph from Edith's letter flashed
vividly into his memory: "<i>The door of the
House of Life is open for you and for me, but it
is closed against her. It is in your power at
least to set it ajar for her; to admit her, too,
into full fellowship, through striving and through
love.</i>"</p>

<p>His heart yearned toward her unspeakably.
They belonged to one another in ways<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
that Edith had no part in and never could
have. Suddenly, without looking at her, he
said: "Rosemary, will you marry me?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">What
For?</div>

<p>She turned to him, startled, then averted her
face. Every vestige of colour was gone, even
from her lips. "Don't!" she said, brokenly.
"Don't make fun of me. I must go."</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, trembling, but he
caught her hand and held her back. "Look
at me, dear. I'm not making fun of you.
I mean it&mdash;every word."</p>

<p>She sat down beside him, then, well out of
reach of his outstretched hand. "What for?"
she asked, curiously.</p>

<p>"Because I want you."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Don't you love me?"</p>

<p>"You have no right to ask me that." Her
tone was harsh and tremulous with suppressed
emotion.</p>

<p>"No," he agreed, after a pause, "I suppose
I haven't." She did not answer, so, after
a little, he rose and stood before her, forcing
her eyes to meet his.</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;know?" he asked.</p>

<p>Rosemary hesitated for a moment. "Yes,
I&mdash;know," she said, in a different tone.</p>

<p>"And that was why you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes." Her voice was scarcely audible now.</p>

<p>"It wasn't true, then, that you didn't
love me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Alden
Confesses</div>

<p>She turned upon him fiercely. "What
right have you to ask me all these questions?"
she cried, passionately. "What have you to
offer me? How can you take all I have to give
and give me nothing in return? What is your
love worth? What do you think I am? The
plaything of an idle hour, something to be
taken up or cast aside whenever you may
choose, to be treated kindly or brutally as
your fancy may dictate, to be insulted by your
pity&mdash;by what you call your love? No, a
thousand times no!"</p>

<p>His face was very white and his mouth
twitched, but in a moment he had gained, in a
measure, his self-control. "I don't blame you
in the least, Rosemary. I deserve it all, I
know. But, before you condemn me utterly,
will you listen to me for a few moments?"</p>

<p>She assented, by the merest inclination of
her head.</p>

<p>"I want to be honest with you," he went on,
clearing his throat, "and I want to be honest
with myself. No doubt you think I'm all
kinds of a cad, and rightly so, but, at least,
I've been honest&mdash;that is, I've tried to be.</p>

<p>"When I asked you to marry me, early
in the Spring, I meant it, just as I mean it
now, and I was glad when you said you would.
Then&mdash;she came.</p>

<p>"I had nothing whatever to do with her
coming, in fact, I protested against it, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
mother will tell you if you ask her. I didn't
know her, and I didn't want her, but after I
knew her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alden
Was Glad</div>

<p>"You did want her," said Rosemary, coldly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I wanted her, and she was married
to another man. She had sufficient grounds
for a divorce, though she never told me what
they were, and I pleaded with her to take
advantage of the opportunity. I tried by
every means in my power to persuade her,
and when you&mdash;released me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You were glad," she said, finishing the
sentence for him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, in a low tone, "I was glad.
She decided, finally, to leave it to him. If he
wanted her back, she would go; if he preferred
his freedom, she would give it to him. And,
of course, he wanted her, and he had the
right."</p>

<p>"So she went."</p>

<p>"So she went, and it was all over, and we
shall never see each other again."</p>

<p>"It's too bad," said Rosemary, icily. "I'm
sorry for you both."</p>

<p>"Listen dear," he pleaded. His face was
working piteously now. "I wish I could
make you understand. I loved her, and
I love her still. I shall love her as long
as I live, and perhaps even after I'm dead.
And she loves me. But, because of it, in
some strange way that I don't comprehend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
myself, I seem to have more love to give others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He States
His Case</div>

<p>"I care more for my mother because I love&mdash;Edith,
and, queer as you may think it, I
care more for you. She has taken nothing
away from you that I ever gave you&mdash;you
are dearer to me to-day than when I first
asked you to marry me, so long ago. I don't
suppose you'll believe it, but it's the truth."</p>

<p>"I believe what you tell me," Rosemary
said, in a different tone, "but I don't understand
it."</p>

<p>"It's like this, Rosemary. My loving her
has been like opening the door into the House
of Life. It's made everything different for
me. It's made me want to make the best of
myself, to do things for people, to be kind to
everybody. It isn't selfishness&mdash;it's unselfishness.</p>

<p>"I told you once that I wanted to take you
away from all that misery, and to make you
happy. It was true then, and it's true now,
but, at that time, I was bound in shallows and
didn't know it. She came into my life like an
overwhelming flood, and swept me out to
sea. Now I'm back in the current again, but
I shall know the shallows no more&mdash;thank
God!</p>

<p>"If you'll believe me, I have more to give
than I had then&mdash;and I want you more. I'm
very lonely, Rosemary, and shall be always,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
unless&mdash;but, no, I don't want your pity; I
want your love."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Philanthropic
Scheme</div>

<p>There was a long pause, then Rosemary
spoke. "Service," she said, half to herself,
"and sacrifice. Giving, not receiving. Asking,
not answer."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Alden, with a sigh, "it's
all of that.</p>

<p>"Leaving love aside," he went on, after a
little, "I believe you'd be happier here, with
mother and me, than you are where you are
now. You'd be set free from all that drudgery,
you could help me in my work, and, though
I'm not rich, I could give you a few of the
pretty things you've always wanted. We
could go to town occasionally and see things.
Moreover, I could take care of you, and you've
never been taken care of. I don't think you'd
ever be sorry, Rosemary, even though you
don't love me."</p>

<p>"I never said I didn't love you," the girl
faltered. Her eyes were downcast and the
colour was burning upon her pale face.</p>

<p>"Yes, you did&mdash;up on the hill. Don't you
remember?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wasn't telling the truth," she confessed.
"I've&mdash;I've always&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rosemary!"</p>

<p>She looked at him with brimming eyes.
"What you've done, or what you may do,
doesn't make any difference. It never could.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
If&mdash;if it depends at all on&mdash;on the other
person, I don't think&mdash;it's love."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Her
Very
Own</div>

<p>In an instant his arms were around her, and
she was crying happily upon his shoulder.
"Dear, my dear! And you cared all the
time?"</p>

<p>"All the time," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"What a brute I was! How I must have
hurt you!"</p>

<p>"You couldn't help it. You didn't mean
to hurt me."</p>

<p>"No, of course not, but, none the less I did
it. I'll spend the rest of my life trying to
make up for it, dear, if you'll let me."</p>

<p>It flashed upon Rosemary that this was not
at all like the impassioned love-making to
which she had been an unwilling witness, but,
none the less, it was sweet, and it was her very
own. He wanted her, and merely to be
wanted, anywhere, gives a certain amount of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, dear," Rosemary put up her
trembling lips, answering to him with every
fibre of body and soul.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, dear girl, please don't! I want
to make you happy."</p>

<p>Rosemary released herself, wiped her eyes
upon a coarse handkerchief, then asked the
inevitable question:</p>

<p>"Will she care?"</p>

<p>"No, she'll be glad. Mother will too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A
Promise</div>

<p>"Grandmother won't," she laughed, hysterically,
"nor Aunt Matilda."</p>

<p>"Never mind them. You've considered
them all your life, now it's your turn."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem that I deserve it," whispered
Rosemary, with touching humility.
"I've never been happy, except for a little
while this Spring, and now&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"And now," he said, taking her into his
arms again, "you're going to be happy all
the rest of your life, if I can make you so.
If I don't you'll tell me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I can't promise," she murmured, shyly,
to his coat sleeve. "I must go now, it's
getting late."</p>

<p>"Not until you've told me when you'll
marry me. To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" cried Rosemary. "Not to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's too soon."</p>

<p>"In a week, then?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know. I'll see."</p>

<p>"Make it very soon, my dear, will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;just as soon as I can."</p>

<p>"Is that a promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a promise."</p>

<p>"Then kiss me."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Half
Afraid</div>

<p>The white fire burned in Rosemary's blood;
her heart beat hard with rapturous pain.
Upon the desert wastes that stretched end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>lessly
before her, Spring had come with the
old, immortal beauty, and more than mortal
joy. Half afraid of her own ecstasy, she
broke away from him and ran home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Just
Wait</div>

<p>"Rosemary!"</p>

<p>Grandmother called imperiously, but
there was no answer. "Rosemary!" she
cried, shrilly.</p>

<p>"She ain't here, Ma," said Matilda. "I
reckon she's gone out somewheres."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see the beat of it? She's
getting high and mighty all of a sudden. This
makes twice lately that she's gone out without
even tellin' us, let alone askin' whether
she could go or not. Just wait till she comes
back."</p>

<p>Matilda laughed in her most aggravating
manner. "I reckon we'll have to wait," she
retorted, "as long as we don't know where
she's gone or when she's comin' back."</p>

<p>"Just wait," repeated Grandmother, ominously.
"I'll tell her a thing or two. You
just see if I don't!"</p>

<p>The fires of her wrath smouldered dully,
ready to blaze forth at any moment. Matilda
waited with the same sort of pleasurable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
excitement which impels a child to wait under
the open window of a house in which there is
good reason to believe that an erring playmate
is about to receive punishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tense
Silence</div>

<p>"What's she been doin' all day?" Grandmother
demanded.</p>

<p>"Nothin' more than usual, I guess," Matilda
replied. "She did up the work this morning
and got dinner, and washed the dishes and went
to the store, and when she come back, she
was up in the attic for a spell, and then
she went out without sayin' where she was
goin'."</p>

<p>"In the attic? What was she doin' in the
attic?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"She's got no call to go to the attic. If
I want her to go up there, I'll tell her so.
This is my house."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Matilda, with a sigh.
"I've heard tell that it was."</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted Grandmother.</p>

<p>For an hour or more there was silence, not
peaceful, but tense, for Grandmother was
thinking of things she might say to the wayward
Rosemary. Then the culprit came in,
cheerfully singing to herself, and unmindful
of impending judgment.</p>

<p>"Rosemary!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Grandmother. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Come here!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grandmother
chides
Rosemary</div>

<p>Rosemary obeyed readily enough, though
she detected warlike possibilities in the tone.</p>

<p>"Set down! I've got something to say
to you!"</p>

<p>"I have something to say to you, too,
Grandmother," Rosemary replied, taking the
chair indicated by the shaking forefinger.
For the first time in her life she was not afraid
of the old lady.</p>

<p>"I've noticed," Grandmother began, tremulously,
"that you're getting high and mighty
all of a sudden. You've gone out twice lately
without askin' if you might go, and I won't
have it. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I hear you," the girl answered. "Is that
all?"</p>

<p>"No, 'tain't all. You don't seem to have
any sense of your position. Here you are a
poor orphan, beholden to your grandmother
for every mouthful you eat and all the clothes
you wear, and if you can't behave yourself
better 'n you've been doin', you shan't stay."</p>

<p>A faint smile appeared around the corners
of Rosemary's mouth, then vanished. "Very
well, Grandmother," she answered, demurely,
rising from her chair. "I'll go whenever
you want me to. Shall I go now?"</p>

<p>"Set down," commanded the old lady.
"I'd like to know where you'd go!"</p>

<p>"I'd go to Mrs. Marsh's; I think she'd
take me in."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rosemary's
Rejoinder</div>

<p>"You've got another think comin' then,"
Grandmother sneered. "Didn't I tell you
to set down?"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Rosemary, coolly, "but
I'm not going to. I said I had something to
say to you. I'm going to be married next
week to Alden Marsh. I've taken enough of
the money my father left me to buy a white
dress and a new hat, and the storekeeper has
sent to the City for me for some white shoes
and stockings. I'm going to have some pretty
underwear, too, and a grey travelling dress.
I've just come from the dressmakers, now."</p>

<p>"Money!" screamed the old lady. "So
that's what you've been doin' in the attic.
You're a thief, that's what you are! Your
mother was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" said Rosemary. Her voice was
low and controlled, but her face was very
white. "Not another word against my mother.
You've slandered her for the last time. I
am not a poor orphan, beholden to my grandmother
for the food I eat and the clothes I
wear. On the contrary, you and Aunt Matilda
are dependent upon me, and have been for a
good many years. I have father's letter here.
Do you care to read it?"</p>

<p>Shaken from head to foot, the old lady sank
into her chair. She was speechless, but her
eyes blazed. Matilda sat by the window, dumb
with astonishment. This was not at all what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
she had expected. Rosemary had drawn a
yellow old letter from the recesses of her brown
gingham gown and was offering it to Grandmother.
The sight of it had affected the old
lady powerfully.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Money</div>

<p>"Very well," Rosemary was saying, as she
returned the letter to its hiding-place. "In
case you've forgotten, I'll tell you what's
in it. The day father sailed up the coast, he
sent you a draft for more than eleven thousand
dollars. He said it was for me&mdash;for my clothes
and my education, in case anything happened
to him. He said that you were to give me
whatever I might want or need, as long as the
money lasted. I'll leave it to you whether
you've carried out his instructions or not.</p>

<p>"Now that I'm going to be married, I've
taken the liberty of helping myself to a small
part of what is my own. There's almost
two thousand dollars left, and you're quite
welcome to it, but I won't be married in
brown gingham nor go to my husband in
ragged shoes, and if I think of anything else I
want, I'm going to have it."</p>

<p>"Ma," said Matilda, tremulously, "if this
is so, we ain't done right by Rosemary."</p>

<p>"It's so," Rosemary continued, turning
toward the figure at the window. "You can
read the letter if you want to." She put her
hand to her breast again, but Matilda shook
her head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grandmother's
Decision</div>

<p>"If you want me to," the girl went on,
"I'll go now. Mrs. Marsh will take me in,
but I'll have to explain why I ask it. I
haven't told Alden, or his mother, and I
don't want to. I won't bring shame upon those
of my own blood if I can help it. But what
I've had, I've earned, and I don't feel indebted
to you for anything, not even a single
slice of bread. That's all."</p>

<p>Grandmother staggered to her feet, breathing
heavily. Her face was colourless, her
lips ashen grey. "Rosemary Starr," she said,
with long pauses between the words, "I'll
never&mdash;speak to&mdash;you&mdash;again as&mdash;long as&mdash;I&mdash;live."
Then she fell back into her chair,
with her hand upon her heart.</p>

<p>"Very well, Grandmother," Rosemary returned,
shrugging her shoulders. "You'll
have to do as you like about that."</p>

<p>By supper-time the household was calm
again&mdash;upon the surface. True to her word,
Grandmother refused to communicate directly
with Rosemary. She treated the girl as she
might a piece of furniture&mdash;unworthy of
attention except in times of actual use.</p>

<p>She conveyed her wishes through Matilda,
as a sort of human telephone. "Matilda,"
she would say, "will you ask Rosemary to fill
the tea-pot with hot water?" And, again:
"Matilda, will you tell Rosemary to put out
the milk pitcher and to lock the back door?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
It was not necessary; however, for Matilda
to tell Rosemary. The girl accepted the
requests as though they had been given directly&mdash;with
her head held high and the faintest
shadow of an ironical smile upon her face.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Left in the
Dark</div>

<p>After supper, while Rosemary was washing
the dishes, Grandmother took the lamp. She
was half-way to the door when Matilda inquired:
"Where are you goin', Ma?"</p>

<p>"I'm goin' up to my room, to set and read
a spell."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but the lamp?"</p>

<p>"I need it to read by," Grandmother announced,
with considerable asperity, "and
you don't need to hunt around for no more
lamps, neither. I've got 'em all put away."</p>

<p>"But," Matilda objected; "me and Rosemary&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"You and Rosemary! Humph! You can
set in the dark or anywhere else you please."
With that she slammed the door and was gone.
Rosemary came in, after a little, humming to
herself with an assumed cheerfulness she was
far from feeling. Then she went out into the
kitchen and came back with a match. The
feeble flicker of it revealed only Aunt Matilda&mdash;and
no lamp.</p>

<p>"Where's Grandmother?" asked Rosemary,
in astonishment. "And what has become of
the lamp?"</p>

<p>"She's gone up to her room and she's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
took the lamp with her," Matilda laughed,
hysterically.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aunt
Matilda's
Troubles</div>

<p>Rosemary brought in the candle from the
kitchen. As it happened, it was the last
candle and was nearly gone, but it would burn
for an hour or two.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Aunt Matilda," said Rosemary,
kindly, "if you want to read, or anything&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"I don't," she interrupted. "I'd like to
sit and talk a spell. I don't know as we
need the candle. If she should happen to
come back, she'd be mad. She said she'd
put away the lamps, and I reckon she'd have
took the candle, too, if she'd thought."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered Rosemary, blowing
out the candle. "I'm not afraid of the
dark." Moreover, it was not the general policy
of the household to ruffle Grandmother's
temper unnecessarily.</p>

<p>"Rosemary," said Aunt Matilda, a little
later; "Ma's a hard woman&mdash;she always has
been."</p>

<p>"Yes," the girl agreed, listlessly.</p>

<p>"I ain't never said much, but I've had my
own troubles. I've tried to bear 'em patiently,
but sometimes I ain't been patient&mdash;she's
always made me feel so ugly."</p>

<p>Rosemary said nothing, but she felt a
strange softening of her heart toward Aunt
Matilda. "I don't know as you'll believe
me," the older woman went on after a pause,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
"but I never knew nothin' about that
money."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pity for
Aunt
Matilda</div>

<p>"I know you didn't, Aunt Matilda. It's
behind a loose brick in the chimney, in the attic,
on the right-hand side. You have to stand on
a chair to reach it. If you want any of it, go
and help yourself. It's mine, and you're
welcome to it, as far as I'm concerned."</p>

<p>"I don't know what I'd want," returned
Matilda, gloomily. "I ain't never had nothin',
and I've sort of got out of the habit. I did
used to think that if it ever come my way, I'd
like a white straw hat with red roses on it,
but I'm too old for it now."</p>

<p>Tears of pity filled Rosemary's eyes and a
lump rose in her throat. Aunt Matilda's
deprivations had been as many as her own, and
had extended over a much longer period. The
way of escape was open for Rosemary, but
the older woman must go on, hopelessly, until
the end.</p>

<p>"It was sixteen years ago to-night," said
Aunt Matilda, dreamily, "that the minister
come to call."</p>

<p>"Was it?" asked Rosemary. She did not
know what else to say.</p>

<p>"I thought maybe you'd remember it,
but I guess you was too little. You was only
nine, and you used to go to bed at half-past
seven. It was five minutes of eight when he
come."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Minister
Asks to
Call</div>

<p>"Was it?" asked Rosemary, again.</p>

<p>"Yes. Don't you remember hearin' the
door bell ring?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I must have been asleep."</p>

<p>"Children go to sleep awful quick. It was
five minutes of eight when he come."</p>

<p>"Were you expecting him?"</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't. He'd said to me once, on
the way out of church after Sunday-school:
'Miss Matilda, I must be comin' over to see
you some one of these pleasant evenings, with
your kind permission,' Just like that, he
says, 'with your kind permission,' I was so
flustered I couldn't say much, but I did
manage to tell him that Ma and me would be
pleased to see him any time, and what do you
suppose he said?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Rosemary.</p>

<p>"He said: 'It's you I'm comin' to see&mdash;not
your Ma,' Just like that&mdash;'It's you!'"
Her voice had a new note in it&mdash;a strange thrill
of tenderness.</p>

<p>"And so," she went on, after a pause, "he
come. I was wearin' my brown alpaca that
I'd just finished. I'd tried it on after supper
to see if it was all right, and it was, so I kept
on wearin' it, though Ma was tellin' me all
the time to take it off. Her and me had just
cleaned the parlour that day. It couldn't
have happened better. And when the bell
rang, I went to the door myself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Greetings</div>

<p>"Were you surprised?"</p>

<p>"My land, yes! I'd thought maybe he'd
come, but not without tellin' me when, or
askin' for permission, as he'd said. He come
in and took off his hat just like he was expected,
and he shook hands with Ma and me. He only
said 'How do you do Mis' Starr?' to her, but
to me, he says: 'I'm glad to see you, Miss
Matilda. How well you're looking!' Yes&mdash;just
like that.</p>

<p>"We went and set down in the parlour.
I'd cleaned the lamp that day, too&mdash;it was
the same lamp Ma's took up-stairs with her
now. It was on the centre-table, by the basket
of wax-flowers under the glass shade. They
was almost new then and none of 'em was
broken. They looked awful pretty.</p>

<p>"Ma came in the parlour, too, and she set
down between him and me, and she says:
'I've been wantin' to ask you something
ever since I heard your last sermon, three
weeks ago come Sunday. I ain't been to
church since and I can't feel like I ought to
go.'</p>

<p>"'I'm sorry,' he says, just as gentle. 'If
you have any doubts that I can clear up,' he
says, 'about the Scripture&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"''Tain't the Scripture I'm doubtin',' says
Ma, 'it's you.'</p>

<p>"'That isn't as bad,' he says, smilin',
but I could see he was scared. You know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
how Ma is&mdash;especially when you ain't used
to her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discussing
Baptism</div>

<p>"'I'd like to ask,' says Ma, 'whether you
believe that unbaptised infants is goin' to be
saved.'</p>

<p>"'Why, yes,' he says. 'I do,'</p>

<p>"'I suspicioned it,' Ma says. Oh, her
voice was awful! 'May I ask you just what
grounds you have for believin' such a thing?'</p>

<p>"'I don't know as I could tell you just
what grounds I have,' he says, 'but I certainly
feel that the God I humbly try to serve is not
only just but merciful. And if there's anything
on earth purer or more like a flower than
a little baby,' he says, 'I don't know what it
is, whether it's been baptised or not. I don't
think God cares so much about forms and
ceremonies as he does about people's hearts,'
Them's the very words he said.</p>

<p>"Well," resumed Matilda, after a pause,
"Ma was bent on arguin' with him, about
that, and baptisin' by sprinklin' or by immersion,
and about the lost tribes of Israel, and
goodness knows what else. He didn't want
to argue, and was all the time tryin' to change
the subject, but it was no use. I never got
a chance to say a dozen words to him, and
finally, when he got up to go, he says: 'I've
had a very pleasant evenin', and I'd like to
come again sometime soon, if I may,' he says.
Just like that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A
Souvenir</div>

<p>"And before I could say a word, Ma had
said: 'I dunno as we feel ourselves in need of
your particular brand of theology,' she says.
'It's my opinion that you ought to be up
before the trustees instead of around callin'
on faithful members of the church, sowin'
the seeds of doubt in their minds.'"</p>

<p>"His face turned bright red, but he shook
hands with Ma, very polite, and with me.
I've always thought he squeezed my hand a
little. And he says to me, very pleasant:
'Good-night, Miss Matilda,' but that was all,
for Ma went to the door with him and banged
it shut before he'd got down the steps.</p>

<p>"The day before he went away, I met him
in the post-office, accidental, and he says:
'Miss Matilda, I've got somethin' for you
if you'll accept it,' and he took me over to one
side where there couldn't nobody see us, and
he give me his tintype. And he says: 'I hope
you'll always remember me, Miss Matilda.
You'll promise not to forget me, won't you?'</p>

<p>"And I promised," she resumed, "and I
ain't. I've always remembered."</p>

<p>There was a long silence, then Miss Matilda
cleared her throat. "Light the candle, Rosemary,
will you?"</p>

<p>When the tiny flame appeared, Rosemary
saw that the older woman's face was wet with
unaccustomed tears. She reached down into
the bosom of her dress and drew out a small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
packet, which she removed carefully from its
many wrappings. "See," she said.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It Might
Have
Been</div>

<p>Rosemary leaned over to look at the pictured
face. The heavy beard did not wholly conceal
the sensitive, boyish mouth, and even the
crude art had faithfully portrayed the dreamy,
boyish eyes.</p>

<p>"I want to ask you something," Aunt Matilda
said, as she wrapped it up again. "You're going
to be married yourself, now, and you'll know
about such things. Do you think, if it hadn't
been for Ma, it might have been&mdash;anything?"</p>

<p>Rosemary put out the light. "I'm sure
it would," she said, kindly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rosemary!" breathed the other, with
a quick indrawing of the breath. "Are you
truly sure?"</p>

<p>"Truly," said Rosemary, very softly. Then
she added, convincingly: "You know Alden's
never been to see me but once, and I haven't
even a tintype of him, and yet we're going
to be married."</p>

<p>"That's so. I hadn't thought of that.
I guess you're right." Then she added,
generously, "I'm glad you're goin' to be
married, Rosemary, and I hope you'll be
happy. You've got it comin' to you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Rosemary, choking a
little on the words. "Thank you, dear Aunt
Matilda." Then someway, in the dark, their
arms found each other and their lips met.</p>

<h2 class="gap3 chaphead"><a name="XXV" id="XXV"></a>XXV</h2>

<h2 class="chaphead">A Wedding</h2>


<div class="sidenote">By the
Sea</div>

<p>The air was crystalline and cool, yet soft,
and full of a mysterious, spicy fragrance.
Blue skies arched down at the vast
curve of the horizon to meet a bluer sea.
Snowy gulls swept lazily through the clear
blue spaces, their hoarse crying softened into
a weird music. Upon the dazzling reaches
of white sand, Rosemary was walking with
Alden.</p>

<p>He had his arm around her and her face was
turned toward his. He was radiant with youth
and the joy of living. It was in the spring of
his step upon the sand, the strong, muscular
lines of his body, and, more than all, in his
face. In his eyes were the strange, sweet
fires that Rosemary had seen the day she
was hidden in the thicket and saw him holding
Edith in his arms. But it was all for her
now, for Rosemary, and the past was as dead
as though it had never been.</p>

<p>As they walked, they talked, saying to
each other the thousand dear and foolish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
things that lovers have said since, back in the
Garden, the First Woman looked into the
eyes of the First Man and knew that God had
made her to be his mate. Suddenly a white
cliff loomed up on the beach before them and
from its depths came a tremendous knocking,
as though some one were endeavouring to
escape from a hopeless fastness of stone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Stroke</div>

<p>They paused, but the knocking continued,
growing louder and louder. Then a hoarse
voice called "Rosemary! Rosemary!"</p>

<p>The girl came to herself with a start, rubbing
her eyes. Gaunt and grey in the first
dim light of morning, Aunt Matilda stood over
her, clad in a nondescript dressing-gown.</p>

<p>"Rosemary!" she whispered, shrilly. "Come
quick! Ma's had a stroke!"</p>

<p>They ran back to the old lady's room. In
the girl's confused remembrance the narrow
hallway seemed to be a continuation of the
white, sunlit beach, with the blue sky and
sea changed to faded wall paper, and the
cliff gone.</p>

<p>Grandmother lay upon her bed, helpless,
uttering harsh, guttural sounds that seemingly
bore no relation to speech. Her eyes blazed
at the sight of Rosemary and she tried to sit
up in bed, but could not.</p>

<p>"When?" asked Rosemary.</p>

<p>"Just now," Aunt Matilda answered. "I
was asleep, and when I woke up I heard her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
She must have woke me up. What shall we
do?" she continued, helplessly, after a pause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Lie</div>

<p>"I don't know," Rosemary whispered, almost
stunned by the shock. "I'll dress and
go for the doctor."</p>

<p>In an hour she had returned with the physician,
who felt the old lady's pulse, and shook
his head. In the hall, he interviewed the
other two.</p>

<p>"Has she had any shock?" he asked.</p>

<p>For a moment there was no answer, then
Matilda answered clearly: "No."</p>

<p>"No," echoed Rosemary.</p>

<p>"No unusual excitement of any sort? Or
no bad news?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," Matilda replied,
calmly.</p>

<p>"Nothing unusual," Rosemary assured
him.</p>

<p>"Extraordinary!" he murmured. "I'll be
in again this afternoon."</p>

<p>When he had gone, Aunt Matilda turned
anxiously to Rosemary. "Do you think we
did right? Shouldn't we have told him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what difference it could
make," Rosemary replied, thoughtfully. "I'd
hate to have anybody know what she's done.
Maybe it's my fault," she went on, sadly.
"Perhaps I shouldn't have told her."</p>

<p>"Don't go to blaming yourself, Rosemary.
I don't know why you shouldn't have told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
her. If I'd been you, I'd have told her long
ago&mdash;or had you just found it out?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unable to
Speak</div>

<p>"I've known for quite a while. I don't
think I'd have said anything, though, if I
wasn't going to be married. It didn't seem
as if I could be married in brown gingham
when father meant for me to have everything
I wanted and the money was there."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it for a minute," said
Aunt Matilda, kindly. "You've done just
right and you ain't to blame for what's happened.
It's her own fault."</p>

<p>Rosemary prepared a breakfast tray and
Matilda took it up. "It's better for you to
stay away, Rosemary," she said, "for we
don't want her to get excited." When she
returned, she reported that the old lady had,
with evident difficulty, eaten a little oatmeal
and choked down a cup of coffee. She was
calmer, but unable to speak.</p>

<p>The unaccustomed silence of the house
affected them both strangely. Grandmother
might be up-stairs and helpless but the powerful
impress of her personality still lingered in the
rooms below. Her red-and-black plaid shawl,
hanging from the back of her chair, conveyed
a subtle restraint; the chair itself seemed as
though she had just left it and was likely
to return to it at any moment.</p>

<p>When the doctor came again, in the afternoon,
Matilda went up-stairs with him, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
Rosemary waited anxiously in the dining-room.
It seemed a long time until they came
back and held a brief whispered conference
at the front door. When he finally went out,
Matilda came into the dining-room, literally
tense with excitement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Doctor's
Word</div>

<p>"He says," she began, sinking into a chair,
"that he don't know. I like it in him myself,
for a doctor that'll admit he don't know, when
he don't, instead of leavin' you to find out by
painful experience, is not only scarce, but he's
to be trusted when you come across him.</p>

<p>"He says she may get better and she may
not&mdash;that in a little while she may be up and
movin' around and talkin' again about the
same as she always did, and again, she may
stay just like she is, or get worse. He said
he'd do what he could, but he couldn't promise
anything&mdash;that only time would tell.</p>

<p>"If she stays like this, she's got to be took
care of just the same as if she was a baby&mdash;fed
and turned over and bathed,&mdash;and if she
gets better she can help herself some. Seems
funny, don't it? Yesterday she was rampagin'
around and layin' down the law to you, and
to-day she can't say yes or no."</p>

<p>"She said yesterday," Rosemary returned,
"that she'd never speak to me again as long
as she lived. I wonder if it's true!"</p>

<p>"I wonder!" echoed Matilda. "I'd forgotten
that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Way of
Sacrifice</div>

<p>"I hadn't," said the girl, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"Seems almost as if it might be a judgment
on her," Matilda observed, after a pause.
"She said she'd never speak to you again and
she may never speak to anybody any more.
And I've got to take care of her. That's the
trouble with judgments&mdash;they never hit just
the person they were meant to hit. We're
all so mixed up that somebody else has to be
dragged into it."</p>

<p>Plainly before Rosemary there opened the
way of sacrifice and denial. For a moment
she hesitated, then offered up her joy on the
altar of duty.</p>

<p>"I won't be married, Aunt Matilda," she
said, bravely, though her mouth quivered.
"I'll stay and help you."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I said I wouldn't be married. I'll&mdash;I'll
tell Alden I can't. I'll stay and help
you."</p>

<p>"You won't. I won't have you speak of
such a thing, let alone doing it."</p>

<p>"You can't help it, if I make up my mind."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can. I'll go and see Mrs. Marsh,
and him, and the minister, and the doctor, and
everybody. I'll tell 'em all everything. You
go right on ahead with your gettin' married.
I ain't goin' to have your life spoiled the way
mine has been. You're young yet and you've
got a right to it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Matilda's
Burden</div>

<p>"But&mdash;but, Aunt Matilda!"</p>

<p>"Aunt Matilda nothin'! What could you
do, anyhow? She don't want you anywheres
near her, and the doctor said she mustn't be
excited."</p>

<p>"I could do what I've always done&mdash;cooking
and cleaning and washing and ironing, and I
could carry things up-stairs for you."</p>

<p>"Maybe you could, Rosemary, but you
ain't goin' to. You've served out your time.
Don't you worry about me&mdash;I ain't goin' to
kill myself."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wish you'd let me," Rosemary
stammered.</p>

<p>"Well, I won't, and that's the end of it.
I'll get along someways. The minister used
to say that when God gave any of us a burden
we couldn't carry by ourselves, He'd always
send help, so, if I need help, I'll have it.</p>

<p>"I'll enjoy myself, too, in a way," she went
on, after a little. "It's goin' to seem awful
peaceful to have the house quiet, with no
talkin' nor argument goin' on in it. Sometimes
I've thought that if I could get out of the
sound of the human voice for a spell I wouldn't
feel so ugly. It's wore on me considerable&mdash;never
bein' alone except nights or when I
went up-stairs afternoons and pretended to
take a nap. Lots of times I wasn't lyin'
down at all&mdash;I was just settin' there, with the
door locked, thinkin' how nice and quiet it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
was. Ma'll get a good rest, too, while she
ain't talkin', though it ain't for me to say
she's needed it."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Wedding
Dawn</div>

<p>"So," she continued, clearing her throat,
"you go right on ahead with your marrying."</p>

<p>Rosemary bent and kissed the hollow, withered
cheek. "I will," she said. "Oh, dear
Aunt Matilda! I wish you hadn't missed
it all!"</p>

<p>The older woman's steel blue eyes softened,
then filled. "Maybe I've missed it and maybe
I ain't," she said, huskily. "Maybe this life
is only a discipline to fit us for somethin'
better that's comin'. Anyway, if we keep on
goin' and doin' the best we can as we go, I
believe God will make it right for us later
on."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The morning of Rosemary's wedding dawned
clear and cool. It was Autumn and yet the
sweetness of Summer still lingered in the air.
Scarlet banners trailed upon the maples and
golden leaves rained from the birches, shimmering
as they fell. Amethystine haze lay
upon the valley, shot through with silver
gleams from the river that murmured toward
the sea with the sound of far waters asleep.</p>

<p>Purple lights laid enchantment upon the
distant hills, where the Tapestry-Maker had
stored her threads&mdash;great skeins of crimson
and golden green, russet and flaming orange,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
to be woven into the warp and woof of September
by some magic of starlight and dawn.
Lost rainbows and forgotten sunsets had
mysteriously come back, to lie for a moment
upon hill or river, and then to disappear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Making
Ready</div>

<p>Noon had been chosen for the ceremony,
in the little church at the foot of the Hill of
the Muses, for, as Alden had said, with a
laugh, "even though it was private, it might
as well be fashionable." Aunt Matilda was
up at dawn, putting new lace into the neck
and sleeves of her best brown alpaca, as
tremulous and anxious as though she herself
were to be the bride.</p>

<p>Rosemary had packed her few belongings
the day before, in the little old-fashioned
trunk that had been her mother's. As she
dressed, Aunt Matilda sat on the bed, pathetically
eager to help in some way, though it might
be only to pin up a stray lock or tie a shoe.</p>

<p>Rosemary shook out the dull ashen masses
of her hair with a sigh. As she put it up,
Alden's big betrothal diamond blazed star-like
upon her rough, red hand. She contemplated
it ruefully&mdash;it seemed so out of place&mdash;then
brightened at the memory of the promise
Mrs. Marsh had made so long ago.</p>

<p>"She'll teach me how to take care of my
hands," said Rosemary, half to herself, "so
they'll look like hers."</p>

<p>"She?" repeated Aunt Matilda. "Who?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Matilda's
Compensation</div>

<p>"Mrs. Marsh&mdash;mother."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess she will. She'll teach you
a lot of things Ma and me have never
heard tell of. Maybe you'd just as soon
ask her, Rosemary, why she never returned
my call?"</p>

<p>"I will, surely. I don't think she meant
anything by it, Aunt Matilda. She might
have been busy and forgotten about it. Anyhow,
you'll have to come to see me
now."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will. I've thought I'd put the
minister's tintype up on the mantel now, as
long as Ma ain't likely to see it. It'll be
company for me. And I reckon I'll get me
a cat. I always wanted one and Ma would
never let me have it. I can keep it down-stairs
and she may never know about it, but even
if she hears it meowing, or me talkin' to it,
she can't say nothin' about it.</p>

<p>"My, ain't it beautiful!" she continued, as
Rosemary slipped her white gown over her
head. "Please let me hook it up, Rosemary&mdash;this
is as near as I'll ever come to a wedding.
Are you going in to see her before you
go?"</p>

<p>Rosemary hesitated. "Yes," she sighed,
"I'll go. I think I ought to."</p>

<p>"Don't if you don't want to. I wouldn't
spoil my wedding-day by doing anything I
didn't like to do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grandmother
Relaxes</div>

<p>"I want to," murmured Rosemary. "I
wouldn't feel right not to."</p>

<p>So, when she was ready, she went into the
old lady's room. Happiness made her almost
lovely as she stood there in her simple white
gown and big plumed hat, drawing long white
kid gloves over her red hands.</p>

<p>"Grandmother," she said, tremulously,
"I'm going up to the church now, to be
married to Alden Marsh. Before I go, I
want to tell you I'm sorry if I've ever
done anything I shouldn't do, and ask you
to forgive me for any unhappiness I may ever
have caused you. I haven't meant to do
it, and I&mdash;I believe you've meant to be
good to me. I hope you're glad I'm going
to be happy now."</p>

<p>The stern old face relaxed, ever so little,
the sharp eyes softened with mist, and by
tremendous effort, Grandmother put out a
withered, wavering hand. Rosemary bent
over the bed, lifted her in her strong young
arms, and kissed her twice, then hurried
away.</p>

<p>Alden met them as they were half-way to
the church, and, utterly regardless of two or
three interested children who happened to be
passing, shook hands with Aunt Matilda, then
bent to kiss the flushed and happy face under
the big plumed hat.</p>

<p>"What magnificence!" he said. "I'm un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>worthy
of so much splendour, I'm afraid.
How on earth did you manage it?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Ceremony</div>

<p>Rosemary glanced at Aunt Matilda, then
laughed a little sadly. "Oh," she answered,
with assumed lightness, "I&mdash;just managed it,
that's all."</p>

<p>At the door of the church Madame welcomed
them with an armful of white roses for the
bride. She, too, had a new gown in honour of
the occasion, and her sweet old face was radiant
with smiles. "What a lovely bride," she
said, as she kissed Rosemary. "Oh, my
dear! You mustn't, truly! No tears on a
wedding-day!"</p>

<p>The minister was waiting at the altar.
Madame and Aunt Matilda sat down together
in a front pew; there was a moment's
solemn hush, then the beautiful service
began.</p>

<p>Sunlight streamed through the open windows,
carrying the colour and fragrance of
Autumn into every nook and cranny of the
church. From outside came the cheery piping
of a robin that had paused upon a convenient
window sill to peep in. There was a rush of
tiny, furred feet through the drifted leaves,
and a gleam of scarlet as a falling maple leaf
floated past the open door. In the sunlight
the taper lights on the altar gleamed like great
stars suddenly come to earth.</p>

<p>"That ye may so live together in this life,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
the deep voice was saying, "and in the life
everlasting. Amen!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good-byes</div>

<p>After the benediction, came the minister's
perfunctory congratulations. When he called
her "Mrs. Marsh," Rosemary instinctively
looked toward Madame, then laughed and
blushed when she understood. Madame took
the girl into her arms as she came down from
the altar. "Dear daughter!" she said. "Truly
my daughter, now!"</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda and Rosemary hurried back
to the little brown house, mindful of Alden's
whispered admonition: "Don't keep me waiting
long, dear&mdash;please." Neither spoke until after
Rosemary had changed her gown, and stood
before her mirror in pale lustrous grey, with
hat and gloves to match.</p>

<p>"I'll go in and say good-bye to Grandmother,"
Rosemary said.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. She may be asleep."</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda tiptoed into the old lady's
room, then came out again, with her finger on
her lips. "She's sound asleep," she said,
"and her face looks as if she felt better. I
guess she'll come to herself again all right.
The Starrs have always been healthy and
hard to kill."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Into the
World</div>

<p>So the two went down-stairs quietly. When
the door was opened, Rosemary saw that
Alden was waiting for her at the gate. Smiling
and with joy thrilling her to the utmost fibre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
of her being, Rosemary kissed Aunt Matilda
good-bye, then ran out to where her bridegroom
was waiting, to lead her into the world
of service&mdash;and of love.</p>
